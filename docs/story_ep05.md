# Main Story

## Part 1: Morning After — Isabella's Cosplay
### Main Story

The episode opens the morning after EP04's events. MC visits Isabella in her room, where she's preparing a **Commander White cosplay** from NieR:Automata.

Isabella reveals critical information about Elizabeth:
- She's been watching Elizabeth's pill consumption
- Michael (grandfather) keeps prescribing more medications
- Elizabeth alternates between "zombie" states and crying/vomiting
- Isabella fears "something bad might happen"

*"I think she needs to see another doctor, [daddy_r]. Because honestly? It feels like [grandpa]'s just playing around with her meds."*

The cosplay scene features multiple choice branches where MC helps Isabella dress:

> [!choice] Cosplay Choices (4 decisions)
> Each decision offers "proper help" vs "inappropriate touching" options:
> - Checking outfit: Trust path vs Corruption path
> - Helping with jacket: Professional vs Hands-on
> - Boot buckles: Standard help vs "Guide my hands"
> - Final skirt: Finish properly vs Linger
>
> *Consistent choices unlock achievement: `ep05_ach_isaintro`*

Isabella kisses MC at the end regardless of choices, then sends him to check on Elizabeth.

---

## Part 2: Elizabeth's Introduction — Present Day
### Main Story

MC finds Elizabeth's door open—unusual for her. Inside, he discovers a disturbing scene:
- Elizabeth sitting in babydoll lingerie, staring at the floor
- Pill bottles scattered everywhere (different colors, labels)
- Smeared makeup from crying
- She's swallowing pills dry "like candy"

*"She's picking up more pills... swallowing them dry... Like they're candy."*

Elizabeth barely recognizes MC, her words slurring. She pulls him close, acting affectionate but clearly dissociated.

---

## Part 3: The Flashback — Elizabeth's Past
### Main Story (Critical Context)

The narrative shifts to a **flashback** when MC was a teenager studying for a calculus test. This scene reveals the origins of Elizabeth's inappropriate behavior.

Elizabeth returns from a modeling gala, tipsy on champagne, and offers to "tutor" MC. The scene escalates with increasingly uncomfortable advances:

Key moments:
- Elizabeth uses calculus metaphors with sexual undertones ("limits," "approaching but not crossing")
- She sits progressively closer, eventually in MC's lap
- References to her Milan modeling career
- Tea "accident" ruins her dress
- She leads MC to her bedroom in lingerie

> [!choice] Critical Branch: Young Amber Witnesses
> - **Freeze in place** → Young Amber walks in and sees Elizabeth on top of MC
>   - Sets `ep05_ambersus_eli = True` (Amber suspicious of Elizabeth)
>   - Unlocks achievement `ep05_ach_ambvseli`
> - **Push her away** → MC rejects Elizabeth before Amber enters
>   - Sets `ep05_ambersus_eli = False`
>   - Unlocks achievement `ep05_ach_novseli`

If Amber witnesses the scene, Elizabeth screams at her viciously:
*"Go back to bed! This doesn't concern you, you stupid little girl!"*

This flashback explains:
- Why MC left home (trauma from Elizabeth's advances)
- Elizabeth's long history of inappropriate behavior
- Amber's potential awareness of Elizabeth's actions
- The origin of family dysfunction

---

## Part 4: Elizabeth's Shower — Present Day
### Main Story

Back in present day, Elizabeth is in the shower. Depending on previous choices, MC may interact with her. The scene shows Elizabeth's deteriorating mental state—she barely registers reality.

---

## Part 5: Video Call with Paz
### Main Story

MC contacts Paz to check on her after the masked woman attack. Paz has recovered and shares new findings:

**Key Revelations:**
1. She recovered photos from MC's apartment showing a **ritual circle** with 9 metal balls
2. A mysterious **key** was at the center of the arrangement
3. All evidence from the Tanaka case has been deleted from police systems
4. Someone with high-level access is covering tracks

*"Digital trail's cold. Someone's got access who shouldn't."*

Paz proposes investigating together "off the books" and wants to steal the key from evidence storage.

> [!choice] Critical Branch: Integrity Choice
> - **Support stealing evidence** → MC Integrity -8
> - **Insist on legal methods** → MC Integrity +8
>
> *This choice affects MC's morality score significantly*

If MC supports theft, Paz goes immediately to retrieve the key. If not, she gives him 24 hours to find another way.

---

## Part 6: The Japanese Bath — Madison & Nanami
### Main Story

Isabella leads MC to a hidden Japanese bath (converted greenhouse) where Madison takes Nanami for "traditional bonding."

> [!choice] Branch: Wait or Approach
> - **Wait for Madison to leave** → MC observes secretly, witnesses Madison kissing Nanami
> - **Check on Nanami now** → Madison catches MC, accuses him of being a predator

### If MC Waits (Voyeur Path)

MC witnesses Madison's manipulation of Nanami:
- Madison brings water, then "shares" it by kissing Nanami
- Nanami is confused but doesn't resist
- Madison's possessive behavior becomes clear

*"Did she just—? With Nanami?"*

### If MC Approaches (Caught Path)

Madison confronts MC aggressively:
*"Another man thinking he has the right to invade a woman's space. Did [daddy] teach you to be a peeping tom?"*

She threatens to tell Nanami that MC "tried something" and drives him away.

---

## Part 7: Elizabeth's Complete Breakdown
### Main Story (Pivotal Scene)

Elizabeth spirals into a devastating mental breakdown, alone in her room. She cycles through different lingerie, drinking wine and taking pills, becoming increasingly dissociated.

The scene is presented through fragmented, slurred internal monologue:

*"Pills for breakfast... lunch... dinner... my whole fucking life."*

*"Twenty years as decoration in this house. Twenty years as... the ornament on his shelf."*

Elizabeth reveals her true identity:
- Her real name is **Bianca** (from Milan)
- "Elizabeth" was chosen to fit Michael's image
- She was once called "The European Rose" in modeling

The breakdown escalates:
- She strips naked, unable to recognize herself
- Destroys the mirror screaming "OLD BITCH! DIE! DIE! DIE!"
- Cuts herself on the glass
- Collapses in a pool of blood

*"Need... need a new skin. New face. Paris... Paris will take me back."*

MC and Amber find her unconscious and bloody. They call emergency services.

---

## Part 8: The Hospital — Day One
### Main Story

**DAYS LATER** — Elizabeth is hospitalized. MC encounters various characters:

### Nanami's Visit

Nanami brings flowers and asks difficult questions about her experiences with Madison:

*"When Madison touches me... in certain places... It makes me feel weird but not... not bad weird. Is that normal?"*

Multiple dialogue choices determine how MC responds to Nanami's confusion about boundaries and Madison's behavior.

If MC was drunk with Nanami in EP04, she asks about that night:
*"I keep remembering... w-weird stuff. Like bits and pieces."*

### Madison's Confrontation

Madison arrives and confronts MC about his interaction with Nanami. Two major paths:

> [!choice] Critical Branch: Confrontation Style
> - **Try to defuse peacefully** → Madison offers herself sexually to "protect" Nanami
> - **Put her in her place** → Aggressive confrontation, Madison blackmails MC with photos

**Peaceful Path**: Madison's twisted logic emerges—she'll let MC use her body so he won't "corrupt" Nanami. The scene becomes sexual despite MC's protests.

**Aggressive Path**: Madison threatens to expose MC's "fantasies" and mentions a compromising photo she has. MC leaves in anger.

---

## Part 9: Paz at the Hospital
### Main Story

Paz visits and updates MC on the investigation. She's retrieved the mysterious key (if MC supported the theft) or found another way to examine it.

Their partnership deepens as they discuss the Kobe Yamaguchi-gumi case and the cover-up within the police.

---

## Part 10: Amber's Hospital Scene
### Main Story

Amber visits Elizabeth and has an emotional scene with MC. Depending on whether she witnessed Elizabeth's past behavior in the flashback, their conversation differs significantly.

If Amber witnessed the incident:
*"I always knew something was wrong with [mom]. That night confirmed it."*

---

## Part 11: The Final Confrontation — Michael
### Main Story (Major Revelation)

Madison texts MC to meet at the hospital. When he arrives, **Michael** (MC's father) is waiting.

Michael reveals the truth about Elizabeth's treatment:
- He's been giving her **memory reconsolidation inhibitors**
- Elizabeth witnessed something years ago that "endangered everyone"
- He's been systematically erasing her memories
- The medications are experimental, custom-compounded at his clinic

*"I protected her the only way I could – by helping her forget."*

*"Your [mother]'s condition requires specialized treatment that isn't available through conventional channels."*

Michael has had Elizabeth **committed for psychiatric evaluation** (72 hours minimum, extendable to 30 days).

The confrontation escalates with Michael's contempt:
- He mocks MC's career ("failed detective")
- Threatens to release security footage from the house
- Reveals he has surveillance of MC's activities with family members
- Claims Elizabeth is "one of my greatest achievements" as a case study

*"She's a case study in successful memory modification. One of my greatest achievements."*

Madison acts completely submissive to Michael throughout, accepting his condescension without resistance—a stark contrast to her usual behavior.

MC is left powerless:
*"He's walking away. Just... walking away like I'm nothing."*

---

## Part 12: Antonella's True Nature — Episode Ending
### Main Story (Act One Climax)

The scene shifts to an **unknown location** where Antonella performs her role as yakuza assassin.

A woman accused of betrayal (she claims her mother had a stroke) is tortured. Antonella and a surgeon extract **cocaine packets from her breast implants** while she begs for mercy.

Antonella shows dual nature:
- Cold and efficient during the operation
- Privately apologizes to the dying woman: *"I'm so sorry... I'm so, so sorry..."*
- Promises to tell the woman's mother she tried to come home
- Then reverts to coldness: *"This garbage is no longer our concern."*

### Antonella's Mission

Hiroshi Yoshida gives Antonella her next assignment:
- **Eliminate the detective leading the Tokyo investigation**
- Make it look like gang violence
- Blame the Sumiyoshi-kai to cover Kudō-kai expansion

*"This detective won't see you coming."*

(The detective is almost certainly MC or someone close to him.)

### The Temple Ritual — Final Scene

Antonella performs a **kitsune (fox spirit) ritual** at a Shinto temple, speaking to herself in third person:

*"Come, little fox spirit. Time to return to sacred ground."*

She strips naked before the fox statues, touching her scars:
- Isabella's birth scar
- Bullet wounds from "when evil tried to silence you"

She dons a **green fox mask**:
*"In folklore, green foxes bring important messages to those who need guidance."*

*"Soon you'll find him again. The good man who deserves to know the truth about his world."*

**END OF ACT ONE**

# Main Story
*The following sections occur regardless of player choices*

## Part 1: Tokyo Guesthouse — Present Day
### Main Story

The episode opens in the quiet darkness of the Tokyo guesthouse. MC lies awake, unable to sleep. His thoughts are bitter—his family thrived during his absence, proving how unnecessary he truly is. The bright, empty room feels foreign compared to his cramped Osaka apartment.

*"Being here... feels like I'm trying to fit into someone else's life that ain't mine."*

When he closes his eyes, only Osaka comes to him—the one place where he feels he belonged. And so the memories begin.

---

## Part 2: The Love Hotel — Osaka Flashback
### Main Story

MC is in a love hotel with Aoi, a prostitute he visits regularly. The encounter is rough, aggressive—MC uses sex as an escape, refusing to engage emotionally.

When Aoi tries to make conversation, MC shuts her down:

*"I pay you to fuck, not to be my shrink."*

During the act, MC loses himself entirely. He begins calling Aoi by another name—**Antonella**. He thrusts harder, speaking to someone who isn't there:

*"Did you miss me, Antonella? Is this what you been dreaming about?"*

*"You shouldn't have left, Antonella! You should have stayed with me!"*

Aoi is confused and concerned. She realizes MC is deeply broken—haunted by someone from his past. Despite his cruelty, she offers him something unexpected: anal sex, hoping it might help him "escape."

> [!note] The Antonella Connection
> This scene establishes that even years after Antonella's disappearance, MC cannot let her go. He searches for her in every woman he's with.

---

## Part 3: Walking Home — Depression
### Main Story

After leaving the love hotel, MC walks through Osaka's rain-soaked streets. His internal monologue reveals the depths of his despair:

*"I was so done with that life... hookers, drugs, booze. All were just ways to kill time until the next high."*

*"I didn't even know why I was still a cop."*

He reflects on his original motivation for joining the police—to find Antonella. But that search led nowhere, and somewhere along the way, he lost himself entirely. He acknowledges being a terrible father to Isabella, believing she's better off without him.

---

## Part 4: Paz's Confrontation
### Main Story

MC arrives at his apartment building to find Paz waiting for him. She's furious—he's been missing work, and the station is demanding answers.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Checking Out Paz
> MC must look at both her breasts and her legs (in any order) before the conversation continues. This represents his inability to see women as anything but objects.

Paz tries desperately to reach him:

*"I'm worried about you. I know you're hurting. Please, don't push me away. Let me help you."*

> [!choice] Branch Point: Response to Station
> - **"I'll talk to them"** → +2 Trust with Paz
> - **"I don't care"** → No points gained
>
> *This affects dialogue but not the overall story progression.*

MC dismisses her concerns, eventually forcing his way past her into his apartment. She calls after him:

*"You're a fucking coward! Why won't you let me in?"*

---

## Part 5: Tobita Shinchi — The Red Light District
### Main Story

The scene shifts to Tobita Shinchi, Osaka's notorious red-light district. MC narrates:

*"This was where the prostitutes made their living, selling their bodies and souls to any fucker with cash."*

He stands outside, smoking, when Aya—Aoi's mother and the brothel's madam—approaches him. She offers unsolicited advice about his life choices.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Response to Aya
> - **"Got it, thanks"** → +1 Integrity
> - **"Fuck off"** → -1 Integrity
>
> *This affects minor dialogue variations.*

Aoi arrives, inviting both MC and her mother inside for drinks. In the dimly lit room, with alcohol flowing, a strange domesticity emerges. MC comments that it almost feels like family.

### The Offer

Both Aya and Aoi offer themselves to MC. They reveal they're both yakuza—members of the criminal underworld. It's meant as a warning, but MC doesn't care.

> [!choice] Branch Point: The Choice
> - **Just Aoi** → Sexual scene with Aoi only
> - **Both of them** → Threesome with mother and daughter
>
> *Affects the sexual content but not the main narrative.*

---

## Part 6: The Yakuza Club — Foreshadowing
### Main Story

The narrative shifts perspective briefly. In a yakuza-run club, **Hideo**—a powerful boss—pressures a young woman named **Rina** to recruit new girls. He wants "fresh meat"—young, untouched women he can exploit.

Rina is clearly uncomfortable but trapped. MC, observing from nearby, reflects on the yakuza's control over Osaka's nightlife:

*"They don't just run the night; they control the fear, the respect, the very lives of anyone ballsy enough to step into their turf."*

> [!important] Narrative Setup
> This scene foreshadows Rina's later betrayal of Arlette. Hideo's threats to Rina explain why she eventually tries to recruit her friend.

---

## Part 7: The Morning After
### Main Story

MC wakes up hungover, surrounded by evidence of his destructive lifestyle. His internal monologue hints at something to come:

*"I didn't know back then... But there was a link between that story and mine..."*

*"A girl... an innocent, caught in the middle of all this chaos."*

*"She was like a flower trying to bloom in a concrete jungle."*

---

## Part 8: Arlette and Rina — Introduction
### Main Story

Two young women walk through Osaka's heat. **Arlette**, a beautiful French woman, and **Rina**, her Japanese friend. They discuss their struggles:

- Arlette is waiting to hear back from a modeling agency
- Rina suggests Arlette try hosting at a club
- Arlette is hesitant—it feels "scummy"
- Rina admits she became a call girl due to debts

Arlette reluctantly agrees to consider it, but makes Rina promise to "have her back."

---

## Part 9: The Talk — Paz and MC
### Main Story

During a daytime patrol, Paz opens up to MC about why she became a cop. Her sister was hurt, and the system failed to protect her. She vowed to make a difference.

MC remains cynical: *"Commitments get broken, Paz. All the damn time."*

Despite his resistance, Paz convinces MC to go out for drinks—as friends, nothing more.

---

## Part 10: The Host Club — Meeting Arlette
### Main Story

Paz brings MC to a popular host club in Dotonbori. Despite his protests, she insists it will be good for him to "just be human" for a night.

Arlette approaches their table—it's her first night as a hostess. She's nervous, out of her element. Paz immediately takes a liking to her, practically forcing MC to engage.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Opening Up
> - **Tell the truth** (about not having chatted like this before) → +1 Trust with Arlette
> - **Avoid answer** → Minor dialogue change, no points

### The Connection

Something unexpected happens. MC and Arlette genuinely connect. The narration becomes almost poetic:

*"You never really know when a moment's gonna change you. I didn't, not until Arlette walked into my life."*

*"We talked, really talked. Not about the weather or the latest idol song, but about dreams, regrets, the hard truths we try to hide..."*

*"Arlette made me feel... human."*

MC returns to the club night after night. It's no longer about the drinks or the company—it's about seeing her face, hearing her laugh.

---

## Part 11: The Beach — Arlette's Past
### Main Story

MC and Arlette walk along Taniwa beach, away from the neon chaos of Osaka. In this quiet moment, Arlette shares her history:

- She grew up in Paris, near Montmartre
- Her parents ran a small café where she dreamed of becoming a designer or painter
- At fifteen, a car crash killed both parents
- She and her grandmother moved to Japan, hoping to start fresh
- Her modeling career failed, debts piled up, and her grandmother fell ill
- Now she works as a hostess to pay for her grandmother's medical care

MC is moved by her story. He sees himself in her—two broken people trying to survive.

*"Because I think you see the world like I do... a bit broken, a bit beautiful."*

---

## Part 12: The Beach House — First Intimate Scene
### Main Story

Back at a beach house, Arlette gives herself to MC completely:

*"I never thought a day like this would come. The day I could trust someone with my mind, my soul, and now... my body."*

> [!choice] Branch Point: Responses During Sex
> Multiple choices appear during the scene:
> - Admitting to fantasizing about her → +1 Corruption
> - Various dirty talk options → +1 Corruption or +1 Trust
> - Where to cum → +1 Corruption (face or tits)

### The Interruption

Their moment is shattered by a phone call. Arlette's grandmother has collapsed. She's in the hospital. MC insists on accompanying her.

As they rush out, Arlette whispers in French: *"Je t'aime..."*

---

## Part 13: The Hospital — MC's Mistake
### Main Story

At the hospital, MC sees Arlette's grandmother frail and fading. In his frustration, he blurts out something he immediately regrets:

*"You gotta break free from all this."*

Arlette explodes. She accuses him of not understanding, of thinking he can fix everything with simple words. The argument escalates:

*"Maybe you should take a good hard look at yourself, [MC]. Maybe you should focus on your own damn problems before you start lecturing me about mine."*

She storms out. MC is left alone, realizing he's pushed too hard.

---

## Part 14: Rina's Betrayal
### Main Story

Away from MC's knowledge, Rina approaches Arlette with a "solution" to her financial problems: prostitution. Rina has connections with the yakuza who can make all of Arlette's debts disappear.

Arlette is horrified but desperate. Rina pushes harder—think of your grandmother.

Later, Arlette is led to a meeting with yakuza representatives (the brothers Yasunobu and Yawata). They explain the "arrangement"—she would become a high-end escort, servicing clients across Asia.

When Arlette hesitates, they reveal photographs—of her grandmother, of MC, of their intimate moments together.

*"Sitting at this table, hearing what you've heard, it's as binding as any signature."*

*"There's no going back now."*

Arlette panics and flees, punching one of them on her way out.

---

## Part 15: The Aftermath — Arlette Seeks Refuge
### Main Story

Arlette appears at MC's apartment, shaking and terrified. She reveals everything—the meeting, the threats, the photos.

*"I can't do this anymore, [MC]. I can't be a fucking sex worker, a prostitute. It's not me, it's not who I am."*

MC promises to protect her. She moves in with him. For a while, they build something resembling a normal life.

### Conditional Intimate Scene

> [!choice] Branch Point: Arlette's Request
> In an attempt to escape her trauma, Arlette asks MC for anal sex:
> - **Agree** → +3 Corruption, unlocks extended intimate scene with multiple sub-choices
> - **Deny** → Scene skips to the montage

---

## Part 16: The Happy Montage
### Main Story

A brief montage shows MC and Arlette building a life together:

- MC works at the police department while obsessively investigating the yakuza
- Arlette takes part-time work
- Her grandmother's condition stabilizes
- The yakuza threats seem to have faded
- They fall deeply in love

*"What we had, it grew into something so fucking deep, the kind of love you don't see every day."*

But MC's obsession with protecting Arlette consumes him. He pushes her away even as he tries to keep her safe.

---

## Part 17: Rina's Plea — Arlette's Refusal
### Main Story

Rina contacts Arlette, begging for help. She's in trouble with the yakuza—they blame her for Arlette's escape.

Arlette refuses. She's built a new life and won't risk it.

*"No, Rina. It's not going to happen."*

*"And you know what? You should get the fuck out of that world, too. Before it's too late."*

Rina leaves in fury, cursing their friendship.

---

## Part 18: Death of the Grandmother
### Main Story

MC and Arlette are cooking dinner together, finally at peace. A phone call shatters everything:

Arlette's grandmother has died. The death was "not natural."

MC suspects foul play—the yakuza taking revenge. His worst fears are realized.

---

## Part 19: The Funeral — The Breakup
### Main Story

At the funeral, Arlette is devastated. She tells MC she's been thinking:

*"I'm broken, [MC]. And I'm afraid that... that I'm breaking you too."*

She tells him it's over. She can't let him destroy himself for her.

> [!choice] Branch Point: MC's Response
> - **"I'd do anything for you"** → +1 Trust with Arlette
> - **"I had to protect you"** → +1 Trust, +2 Integrity
> - **"It needed to be done"** → -2 Integrity

Despite his pleas, Arlette walks away.

*"Goodbye, [MC]. You'll always have my heart."*

---

# Major Branch: The Yakuza Confrontation

## Part 20: Revenge Night
### Main Story

Consumed by rage and grief, MC investigates obsessively. He traces the yakuza, calls in favors, and eventually finds their hideout.

He storms into Hideo's office, gun drawn. The room is filled with armed yakuza—Hideo's bodyguards, knife-wielding enforcers, and the mysterious female bodyguard.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Survey the Room
> MC must check left, right, and back to assess the threats before continuing. This builds tension without affecting the outcome.

Hideo mocks MC, calling him a pathetic cop playing hero.

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Walk Away or Attack
> - **Walk away** → +5 Integrity, MC threatens but leaves
> - **Attack him** → -5 Integrity, MC initiates a shootout

### Branch A: Walking Away

MC backs down, threatening:

*"Just know that if you or any of your men touch Arlette, I'll come for you. Every single one of you."*

He leaves with his dignity bruised but his life intact.

### Branch B: The Shootout

MC attacks. Chaos erupts—he kills several yakuza but Hideo escapes through a hidden exit.

Rina is present, cowering. MC confronts her:

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: Treatment of Rina
> - **Threaten her** → -2 Integrity, MC physically intimidates Rina
> - **Let her go** → +2 Integrity, MC spares her but warns her

Rina confesses that she told the yakuza where Arlette's grandmother was staying—making her complicit in the old woman's death.

---

## Part 21: The Consequences
### Main Story (Both Paths Converge)

MC is broken, whether from the violence or from walking away. Paz calls, demanding to know what happened. MC confesses everything.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Confession to Paz
> - **"Everything's over..."** → +2 Trust with Paz
> - **"I screwed up bad"** → +1 Trust with Paz
> - **"I'm done, Paz"** → No points

Paz comes to his apartment. They talk. She offers her support despite the risks to her own career.

Suddenly, a car pulls up outside—Hideo has found them.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Protecting Paz
> - **"I couldn't let her stay"** → +2 Integrity, MC tries to protect Paz
> - **"I needed a distraction"** → -2 Integrity, MC uses Paz as bait

MC pushes Paz out of the car and speeds away, drawing Hideo after him.

---

## Part 22: Near Death
### Main Story

Hideo catches up to MC in a tunnel. MC is beaten, facing execution.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Final Words
> - **"I did what was right"** → +1 Integrity
> - **"Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot"** → -1 Integrity

Just as Hideo is about to pull the trigger, his own bodyguard—the mysterious woman—shoots him dead.

She speaks cryptically to MC:

*"You still have so much to do. Your story, your plan... it's far from over."*

*"I've been watching you, [MC]. For a long time. You have a purpose. And I'm here to make sure you fulfill it."*

Before MC loses consciousness, she adds something chilling:

*"And don't worry about the haircut... I always did like you better with longer hair... Handsome."*

> [!important] Mystery Setup
> This woman knows MC personally, intimately. Her identity remains a mystery. The implication that she's been watching him "for a long time" and knows his haircut preferences suggests a deeper connection—possibly Antonella herself?

---

## Part 23: Hospital Reunion — Final Breakup
### Main Story

MC wakes in a hospital. Arlette is there—Paz called her. But instead of a reunion, it becomes their true goodbye.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Why He Did It
> - **"I'd do anything for you"** → +1 Trust with Arlette
> - **"I had to protect you"** → +1 Trust, +2 Integrity
> - **"It needed to be done"** → -2 Integrity

Arlette thanks him for everything but insists she must let him go:

*"You'll always be my hero, [MC]. You saved me in so many ways. But I can't let you destroy yourself for me. I won't let you."*

She leaves. This time, it's permanent.

---

## Part 24: Isabella's Visit — Return to Present
### Main Story

MC lies in the hospital, alone with his thoughts:

*"Maybe this was a sign. A cruel, painful sign that it was time for me to focus on something else, anything else..."*

*"My job, my daughter, my own fucking sanity."*

The door opens. Isabella runs in, concerned:

*"Daddy! Daddy! Are you okay?"*

The episode ends with MC realizing he needs to stop chasing love that destroys him and focus on the family he still has.

# Thematic Elements

## Self-Destruction and Redemption
The episode shows MC at his lowest—using sex and substances to escape his pain. Yet through Arlette, he glimpses the possibility of redemption, only to lose it again.

## Women as Casualties
Antonella's absence haunts MC. Aoi is reduced to a vessel for his fantasies. Arlette becomes collateral damage in his war against the yakuza. Rina is trapped in a cycle of exploitation. The episode paints a bleak picture of how MC's obsessions harm the women around him.

## The Cycle of Violence
MC cannot escape violence. Whether he walks away or fights, the result is the same—Hideo is dead, and MC is left bleeding in a tunnel. The mysterious woman's intervention suggests forces beyond his control are at play.

## Letting Go
The episode ends with MC realizing he must stop chasing love that destroys him. His daughter Isabella represents a different kind of love—one he's been neglecting.

---

# Mystery Elements

## The Mysterious Bodyguard
The woman who kills Hideo and saves MC is the episode's biggest mystery:
- She knows MC personally ("I always did like you better with longer hair")
- She's been watching him "for a long time"
- She speaks of him having a "purpose" and a "story"
- She works within the yakuza but isn't loyal to them

**Possible Identities:**
- Antonella herself, having changed her appearance
- Someone connected to Antonella
- A completely new character with unknown motivations

## Arlette's Fate
Arlette walks away "forever," but her story feels incomplete. Will she return? Was she truly in danger, or was the grandmother's death coincidental?

## The Yakuza Network
With Hideo dead, who controls his organization? The mysterious woman seemed to act independently—what are her goals?

---

*Episode 02 ends with MC broken but perhaps ready to rebuild. The flashback structure reveals the depth of his trauma while setting up mysteries that will unfold in future episodes. As Isabella reaches for her father in the hospital, there's hope that he might finally learn to accept the love that's been waiting for him all along.*

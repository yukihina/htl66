# Main Story

## Part 1: The Photograph — Opening Scene
### Main Story

MC awakens troubled by the photograph of Antonella discovered in Episode 03. He stares at it, unable to process how it ended up among Isabella's boxes from Osaka.

*"Why on earth did she keep this photo all these years? And why is it here, of all places?"*

*"Just when I thought I was finally starting to forget about her... It's like the universe is conspiring against me, refusing to let me move on."*

Unable to find peace, MC falls into a restless sleep—and is soon awakened by an unexpected visitor at the pool.

---

## Part 2: Enter Nanami — Pool Scene
### Main Story

MC finds a mysterious girl has wandered into the backyard. She's shy, bespectacled, and incredibly nervous. Upon seeing MC, she screams and falls into the pool.

MC rescues her and learns her name: **Nanami**, Madison's best friend who came to study. Her clothes are soaked, her glasses sunk to the bottom, and she's hopelessly apologetic about everything.

Nanami's defining characteristics emerge:
- Extreme shyness and social anxiety
- Low self-esteem (constantly calls herself "fat" and "clumsy")
- No bra or underwear (claims Madison told her not to wear them)
- Unusually large breasts that she's embarrassed about
- Childlike innocence mixed with unconscious sensuality

*"I-I'm sorry for causing so much trouble... M-My name's Nanami. P-Please don't be angry..."*

---

## Part 3: The Clothing Dilemma
### Critical Branch Point

Nanami needs dry clothes, but Madison isn't home. MC must decide how to handle the situation:

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Nanami's Outfit
> - **Let her wear Madison's bikini** → Bikini path (more revealing)
> - **Keep her in just a towel** → Towel path (MC watches her undress)
>
> *Both paths feature MC texting Amber for clothing options, but neither works out.*

### Branch A: Bikini Path

Nanami puts on Madison's bikini, which barely contains her curves. She's mortified but also strangely pleased by MC's reaction.

The scene features:
- Nanami asking if she looks "fat" in the tiny bikini
- MC photographing her (ostensibly for Amber)
- Pool time with possible "[daddy_r]" roleplay
- Escalating physical contact

### Branch B: Towel Path

MC watches Nanami undress from a distance while she changes into a towel. The scene is more voyeuristic but equally charged.

- MC peeks at Nanami's nude body
- She's unaware of being watched
- Later retrieves her glasses by swimming naked
- Same "[daddy_r]" roleplay option available

> [!choice] Branch Point: Daddy Roleplay
> - **Accept being her "daddy"** → +3 Trust, unlocks special dialogue
> - **Decline the request** → -2 Trust, standard dialogue
>
> *Nanami explains she never had a father and wants MC to fulfill that fantasy.*

---

## Part 4: Madison's Arrival — Confrontation
### Main Story

Madison returns home and discovers MC with Nanami. Her reaction is explosive:

*"Well, well, well. What do we have here? A little private party I wasn't invited to?"*

Madison accuses MC of being a "pervert" and treating Nanami inappropriately. The player must choose how to respond:

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Handle Madison
> - **Defend Nanami** → +3 Trust with Nanami, angers Madison, leads to kiss
> - **Make peace with Madison** → +5 Trust with Madison, Nanami is hurt

### If MC Defends Nanami

Madison attacks MC personally, bringing up his abandonment of Isabella:

*"You're a pathetic piece of shit who couldn't even take care of his own [dau_r_low]. Some [da_full_r_low] you are."*

The confrontation ends with Madison dragging Nanami away. Before leaving, Nanami:
1. Trips and falls onto MC's lap
2. Feels his erection
3. **Kisses him on the lips** (her first kiss)
4. Runs away blushing

*"You're my first kiss! I... I've never felt like this before..."*

### If MC Sides with Madison

Nanami is clearly hurt but accepts the situation. Madison leads her away with a knowing smirk, having established dominance.

---

## Part 5: Madison's Manipulation — Cutaway Scene
### Main Story

The narrative briefly follows Madison and Nanami as Madison extracts a promise from her friend:

*"Promise me you'll never trust my [br_full_r_low] again... and if he tries to get in your pants, you'll tell me immediately."*

Nanami reluctantly agrees, cementing Madison's control over her.

---

## Part 6: Isabella's Jealousy
### Main Story

Isabella confronts MC about his time with Nanami. She's dressed provocatively in minimal sleepwear and acts unusually mature—almost seductive.

Key revelations:
- Isabella claims Nanami's innocence is "an act"
- She's been observing MC's reactions to various women
- She knows about the "[daddy_r]" roleplay (if it occurred)
- Isabella quotes Sun Tzu and Hannibal, showing intellectual depth

*"She looks shy and sweet, but she's playing a very... adult game."*

Isabella escalates physically, eventually requesting a kiss:

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Isabella's Kiss
> - **Give her your cheek** → +2 Trust, innocent outcome
> - **Give her your lips** → +5 Trust, +5 Corruption, leads to French kiss
>
> *The lips option leads to Isabella using her tongue and referencing military strategy about "winning" MC.*

If MC kisses Isabella on the lips:

*"This is what a war looks like, [daddy_r]. As Sun Tzu said, 'The supreme art is subduing without fighting'."*

Isabella leaves with a warning that she'll protect MC from "other sluts."

---

## Part 7: Paz's Investigation — Osaka
### Main Story (Cutaway)

The scene shifts to Osaka, where **Paz** (MC's former partner) investigates his apartment per his SMS request from Episode 03.

She discovers:
- Keys arranged in a specific pattern (9 metal balls including center)
- Evidence someone broke in deliberately
- Items clearly meant for MC to find

Before Paz can process her findings, a **masked woman** appears—wielding a katana. The woman:
- Knows Paz's name
- Claims "This wasn't meant for you"
- Knocks Paz unconscious with a sword strike
- Takes Paz's gun
- Cryptically references "the next phase"

*"You weren't supposed to be here... but you've done my work for me."*

> [!warning] Mystery Deepens
> The masked woman appears to be connected to Antonella's photograph and has been deliberately leaving clues for MC.

---

## Part 8: Late Night Kitchen — Nanami Returns
### Main Story

Unable to sleep, MC goes to the kitchen for a drink. He finds Nanami in revealing sleepwear, searching for her drink that Madison apparently took.

The scene features extensive flirtation and multiple branching paths based on previous choices:

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Give Nanami Beer?
> - **Let her try beer** → Leads to drunken scenes, more sexual content
> - **Keep it innocent (milk)** → Emotional bonding, kiss options

### Beer Path Highlights

Nanami gets progressively drunk:
- Asks about MC's first time having sex
- Becomes physically forward
- Asks for multiple beers
- Eventually needs to go to MC's room because she can't walk

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: More Beer?
> - **Give her more** → Leads to bedroom scene, possible sexual content
> - **Cut her off** → Kiss scene, she hints at "what could have been"

### Milk Path Highlights

A sweeter, more emotional scene where:
- MC tells Nanami about his first kiss with Antonella
- Nanami requests a kiss
- Multiple kiss options available
- She may ask MC to "check" why she feels "hot"

---

1. **Nanami (Drunk)** — Increasingly explicit scenes if player enabled them
2. **Amber** — If relationship is positive, possible hallway encounter leading to her room

## Part 10: Elizabeth — Drunk Encounter

Elizabeth returns home extremely drunk late at night. She's stumbling, slurring, and unusually affectionate.

MC discovers disturbing items in her purse:
- Large amounts of cash
- Numerous pills (she claims are "supplements")
- Evidence of a hidden life

Key moments:
- Elizabeth strips down, showing no modesty

> - **Stay but look away** → +1 Trust, less explicit
> - **Leave** → -2 Trust, skips content

*"These breasts fed you, remember? When you were just a tiny thing..."*

Elizabeth's revelations hint at:

- Possible addiction issues
- Deep loneliness since MC left

### Main Story

The next morning, Paz wakes up in MC's Osaka apartment with a massive headache. She realizes:

SMS exchange between MC and Paz reveals:

## Part 12: Antonella Revealed — Episode Climax
### Main Story

The final scene shifts to an **unknown apartment in Osaka**.

**Antonella is alive.**

She wakes in a modern apartment, receives a phone call from a man named **Hiroshi Yoshida** (referred to as "sir"), and reveals:
- She works as an assassin
- She's being sent to Tokyo
- She's forbidden from contacting "him" (clearly MC)
- She has a split personality or voices ("poor little one")

*"You understand seeing him is still not possible, even in Tokyo."*

Antonella speaks to herself in third person, suggesting psychological fragmentation:

# Thematic Elements

## Innocence and Manipulation
Nanami represents pure innocence—but is she really? Isabella claims it's an act. The truth remains ambiguous, making every interaction with her morally complex.

## Control and Jealousy
Multiple characters compete for MC's attention:
- Isabella wants to "win" him from "other sluts"
- Madison wants to control Nanami's access to him
- Elizabeth wants him to "stay with [mommy_r] forever"

## Hidden Lives
Everyone is hiding something:
- Elizabeth has pills, cash, and a drinking problem
- Antonella is alive and killing people
- The masked woman knows things she shouldn't
- Even innocent Nanami may be playing a game

## Father Figures
The "daddy" theme intensifies:
- Nanami explicitly asks MC to be her daddy
- Isabella calls him daddy with increasingly sexual undertones
- Elizabeth refers to herself as "[mommy_r]" while drunk

---

# Mystery Elements

## The Masked Woman
- Knows Paz and MC by name
- Has a katana and martial arts training
- Left clues deliberately for MC
- Says "the next phase begins"
- Possibly connected to Antonella?

## Antonella's Double Life
- Works as an assassin for Hiroshi Yoshida
- Has psychological fragmentation ("little one")
- Forbidden from contacting MC
- Now heading to Tokyo where MC is

## The Keys and Bells
Paz found 9 metal balls arranged in a pattern with security box keys. The arrangement must mean something—but what?

## Elizabeth's Secrets
- Large amounts of unexplained cash
- Pills that aren't "just supplements"
- Hints that "the industry" used her
- Something happened that she regrets deeply

---

*Episode 04 ends with the earth-shattering revelation that Antonella never died—she became someone else entirely. As she boards a plane to Tokyo, the collision course between MC's past and present becomes inevitable. The question isn't if they'll meet again, but what happens when they do.*

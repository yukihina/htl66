# Main Story
*The following sections occur regardless of player choices*

## Part 1: The Train Journey Begins
### Main Story

MC sits on a train heading to Tokyo, accompanied by his daughter Isabella. He's recovering from injuries sustained during his work as a police detective in Osaka. The medication he's on causes him to drift between consciousness and vivid dreams of his past.

As the train passes through the Japanese countryside, MC's mind wanders. He catches glimpses of Isabella reading beside him—her golden hair and blue eyes painfully reminiscent of her mother. The weight of years lost to his work and emotional distance weighs heavily upon him.

---

## Part 2: First Dream — Meeting Antonella
### Main Story

MC's consciousness drifts back to his high school days. He finds himself watching a girl with striking features reading alone in a school hallway. She looks foreign—half-Japanese, like himself—an outsider among outsiders.

The girl notices him staring and reacts with sharp defensiveness. She demands to know why he's looking at her, her words carrying the edge of someone accustomed to being judged.

> [!note] Minor Choice
> MC can respond that she looks familiar, that she doesn't seem local, or that she looks lonely. This choice has no lasting impact—Antonella responds with dismissive sarcasm regardless.

MC turns to leave, but something unusual happens. Antonella catches up to him, struggling to apologize. Her internal monologue reveals her panic—she's never known how to talk to people, and for the first time, someone looked at her like she was *human*, not just a foreign curiosity.

She awkwardly tells him he's "cool" and mentally berates herself for the fumbled attempt at connection. Yet MC sees through her walls. He tells her she's doing fine, that they're both "freaks" in this place, and that's okay.

Before parting, Antonella asks one final question: "Are you a jerk?"

> [!choice] Branch Point: Responding to Antonella
> - **Honest Response** → +3 Trust with Antonella
> - **Joke About It** → +5 Trust with Antonella
>
> *This early choice sets the foundation for the relationship system.*

She introduces herself properly—her name is Antonella. They exchange names, and she blows him a kiss before immediately regretting it, running away in a flurry of internal screaming.

**MC wakes briefly.** Isabella is concerned, offering water. He's almost home—almost to Tokyo.

---

## Part 3: Second Dream — Antonella's Tree
### Main Story

The dream shifts. MC finds himself in the school hallways again, searching for Antonella. She finds him first, apologizing for her earlier behavior. She asks him to follow her somewhere private—somewhere she can speak freely.

Despite his protests about breaking school rules, MC follows Antonella outside campus. She leads him through temples and gardens until they arrive at a particular tree—a place that holds deep meaning for her.

She asks him to look at the tree, to *see* something. He cannot perceive what she sees. The disappointment in her voice is palpable.

> [!note] Minor Choice
> Whether MC claims to see something, see nothing, or questions if they're looking at the same tree—Antonella's response is the same: resignation that he cannot share in whatever mystery the tree holds.

They sit together beneath the tree. Antonella speaks of someone who showed her this place—a "he" she refuses to name. She makes MC promise not to try discovering who she really is. Not yet. She promises one day she'll tell him everything.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Opinion of Antonella
> - **"Odd but charming"** → +5 Trust
> - **"Mysterious"** → +3 Trust
> - **"You make me uncomfortable"** → No points

The dream ends with Antonella confessing that her heart races when she sees him. They nearly hold hands before—

**MC wakes again.** Isabella watches over him, protective and caring. She tells him they're almost home. He calls her "sweetie" and drifts back to sleep.

---

## Part 4: Third Dream — The Library
### Main Story

In this memory, MC discovers Antonella perched precariously on a tall ladder in the school library. She's searching for a librarian's stamp to check out a book—the library is essentially her second home.

When she notices MC, she loses her balance and falls. He catches her, and for a moment they're close—physically and emotionally. She accuses him of following her, of wanting her.

He denies it flatly. She calls him a "blind loser" who can't see what's right in front of him.

**The phone rings.** MC wakes on the train.

---

## Part 5: SMS Conversation with Paz
### Main Story

MC receives a text message from Paz, his police partner. She apologizes for something she said and for not visiting him in the hospital after he was shot. She's been dealing with fallout from higher-ups related to the case that got MC injured.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Paz's Accidental Photo
> Paz accidentally sends a revealing photo meant for no one. MC can:
> - **Joke about it** → +2 Trust with Paz, leads to sub-branch
> - **Get serious** → +1 Trust with Paz, conversation ends sooner
>
> **Sub-branch (if Joked):**
> - **Say sorry** → +1 Trust
> - **Flirt** → +2 Corruption (Paz sends another photo as a "present")

MC drifts back into memory.

---

## Part 6: Antonella's Favor
### Main Story

The scene shifts to a park where MC waits for Antonella. She's late, and he begins to doubt whether she'll come at all. Just as he's about to leave, she appears—dressed casually, not in school uniform.

She announces they're skipping school together. Despite his protests about exams, MC follows her to her mother's empty office—an art gallery space typically used for exhibitions.

Antonella gives MC a book—the same one he saw her reading when they first met. She says she didn't like the ending, that the author "twisted everything" and made the characters wear masks until nothing made sense anymore.

MC asks about her loneliness. She admits she's always been alone and has difficulty trusting people because "they always leave." When MC says he stayed because he wanted to see who she really was beneath her defenses—

> [!choice] Branch Point: The Embrace
> - **Hug tenderly** → +3 Trust, unlocks additional dialogue later
> - **Hesitate awkwardly** → MC internally berates himself for freezing

Antonella tells MC about her upcoming birthday party. Her parents expect her to invite friends—friends she doesn't have. She asks him to come and pretend they're best friends. Maybe, she suggests, even pretend to be *together*.

---

## Part 7: SMS Conversation with Mom
### Main Story

**Back on the train**, MC receives a text from Mom. She's excited he's coming home, asking about the journey and offering to prepare food. MC responds tiredly, still affected by his medication. He thinks to himself:

*"I just want to see HER again..."*

The "her" remains ambiguous—perhaps Antonella, perhaps someone else.

---

## Part 8: The Game
### Main Story

This lengthy sequence takes place in Antonella's mother's office. Antonella proposes a "game" she invented: they'll ask each other trivia questions about literature. For every wrong answer, the loser removes a piece of clothing.

The game proceeds through six rounds of questions about classic literature—authors of famous works, characters, and literary history.

> [!important] Branching by Performance
> The Game represents the most complex branching in Episode 01. MC's and Antonella's "clothing counters" track who is "winning." The outcomes range from:
> - **Best Outcome** (MC answers all correctly): Antonella removes three items, the scene becomes increasingly intimate
> - **Worst Outcome** (MC answers poorly): MC strips down while Antonella gloats
> - **Mixed Outcomes**: Various combinations of undressing and dialogue

### Best Path — The Prize

If MC achieves a perfect score (no wrong answers), Antonella declares he deserves a "prize." She progressively removes her clothing, offering to let him touch her. MC can barely believe what's happening—this could be his "first time."

Just as things are about to escalate further, the sound of keys in the door interrupts them. Antonella's mother is home. They scramble to dress and flee the office.

### Alternative Path — The Fall

If MC performs poorly, Antonella teases him about his losses. She "accidentally" pushes him, lands on top of him, and they share an intimate moment where she confesses she likes him "a lot."

Again, the mother's arrival interrupts them.

---

## Part 9: The Date
### Main Story

After escaping the office, Antonella and MC spend the day together—bowling, visiting a candy shop. Antonella bowls a strike on her first throw. MC watches her celebrate, finding her beautiful in her simple joy.

> [!note] Time Glitches
> Throughout this sequence, MC experiences "glitches"—moments where time seems to skip forward, scenes feel like recordings playing back. His medication is affecting his perception.

### Conditional: The Kiss

If MC earned enough trust earlier (through the game performance), Antonella kisses him on the cheek while bowling, laughing at how embarrassed he becomes.

---

## Part 10: The Clothing Store
### Branch Point

> [!choice] Optional Path
> - **Yes (visit store)** → Unlocks the Clothing Store sequence
> - **No** → Skip directly to the Park Situation

### The Clothing Store Path

If MC agrees to shop with Antonella, they visit a mall. MC notices a goth girl and must choose whether to approach her or focus on finding a gift for Antonella.

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: Distraction
> - **Chat with goth girl** → -3 Trust with Antonella (she notices), unlocks additional scenes
> - **Find perfect gift** → MC learns Antonella's interests

MC speaks with a salesgirl about birthday gift ideas and learns about jewelry. When Antonella catches up to him, she subtly indicates she likes a particular necklace—information MC will remember later.

In the dressing room, Antonella tries on various outfits, modeling for MC through the mirror. The intimacy of the scene varies based on earlier game performance:
- **High performance**: Antonella invites MC into the dressing room, asks him to rate her body
- **Standard performance**: Antonella teases from behind the curtain

---

# Major Branch: The Park Situation

## Part 11: Amber's Confrontation
### Main Story

As the day winds down, Antonella and MC sit together in a park at sunset. She confesses her feelings:

*"I'm saying that I am in love with you. All I ask is... don't hate me for what I feel, or who I am."*

MC promises he won't hate her. They embrace.

**Then Amber appears.**

MC's sister storms up to them, furious. She accuses MC of cheating, of being with a "bitch." The confrontation escalates—Amber claims to be MC's "girlfriend," that they've been "together since they were kids."

Antonella fires back with sarcasm, mocking Amber's outfit. The situation deteriorates rapidly until MC intervenes.

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: The Park Decision
> This choice significantly affects both the immediate story and long-term relationship dynamics:
>
> - **Go after Amber** → +1 Trust with Amber, leads to Amber path variations
> - **Comfort Antonella** → Stay with Antonella, different dialogue and outcomes

---

## Branch A: Going After Amber

MC chases after his sister, leaving Antonella behind. Amber is hurt, asking if MC ever cared about her or if she was "always just a burden."

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: Amber's Question
> Amber demands to know if Antonella is his girlfriend:
> - **Lie to Amber** → +1 Trust, but leads to complications with Antonella
> - **Tell the truth** → -1 Trust, Amber explodes but respects his honesty eventually

### If MC Lies

Amber calms down, believing they're "just friends." She apologizes to Antonella (superficially). But when MC returns to Antonella, she confronts him about the lie.

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: Explaining to Antonella
> - **Make excuses** → -5 Trust with Antonella (she feels betrayed)
> - **Be honest and apologize** → Antonella understands, forgives him

### If MC Tells the Truth

Amber's fury intensifies. She calls Antonella every insult she can think of. MC stands firm, declaring Antonella is his girlfriend. Amber storms off, crying.

When MC returns to Antonella, she thanks him for not rejecting her.

---

## Branch B: Comforting Antonella

MC stays with Antonella, letting Amber leave. Antonella apologizes for causing drama. MC tells her she did nothing wrong and confesses his love for her directly:

*"I love you, Antonella! And I want to be with you!"*

She's overwhelmed with joy. They agree to work things out with Amber later.

---

## Part 12: The Taxi Incident
### Main Story (All Paths Converge)

After the park confrontation, MC heads home. He spots Amber on the street and calls out to her. In his distraction, he walks into the path of an oncoming taxi.

Amber screams a warning. MC is struck but not seriously hurt. Amber rushes to him, punches him for being "a dumbass," then they walk home together—MC carrying her dramatically when she refuses to cooperate.

---

## Part 13: Home — Amber's Seduction
### Main Story

Back at the family home, Amber's personality shifts to something more provocative. She teases MC about the day's events, her clothing (or lack thereof), and her body.

The dialogue varies significantly based on earlier choices:
- **If MC chose Antonella at the park**: Amber questions whether she's not good enough
- **If MC chose Amber**: She's emboldened, pushing boundaries further
- **If MC lied to Amber**: She believes they have a chance together

> [!choice] Multiple Dialogue Options
> Throughout this scene, MC can:
> - **Reassure Amber** or **Stand ground** → affects Trust
> - **Calm her** or **Be defensive** → affects relationship dynamics

Amber declares that her body is superior to Antonella's, attempting to make MC admit attraction. The scene ends with Amber kissing MC on the cheek and calling him a "pussy" before retreating to her room.

---

## Part 14: Evening Decisions
### Main Story

MC settles into the living room, examining the book Antonella gave him—*"The Darkest Hour."* Before he can read the first page, both Amber and Mom call for him simultaneously.

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Who to Answer First
> - **Answer Mom's call** → Elizabeth/Mom's dress scene
> - **Answer Amber's call** → Amber's bedroom confession scene
>
> *Note: MC will eventually experience both scenes, but the ORDER affects what's available in each.*

---

## Branch Path: Elizabeth's Dress Selection

MC enters his mother's room to find her in lingerie—she's trying on dresses for a modeling audition. Mom is completely nonchalant about her near-nudity, reminiscing about when MC was a baby and breastfed.

> [!choice] Branch: Mom's Memories
> - **Play along** → +2 Corruption with Elizabeth, Mom continues with increasingly inappropriate reminiscing
> - **Stop her** → +1 Trust, MC asserts boundaries

Mom models two dresses—a black one and a red one—asking MC's opinion. The scene is charged with uncomfortable tension as Mom repeatedly draws attention to her figure.

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: Check Her
> If MC didn't play along earlier, he gets another choice:
> - **Check her (look while she changes)** → +1 Corruption
> - **Turn around** → +1 Trust

> [!choice] Dress Selection
> - **Pick black dress** → Mom wears red (contrary)
> - **Pick red dress** → Mom wears black (contrary)

The scene ends when MC accidentally mentions Amber, which irritates Mom.

---

## Branch Path: Amber's Confession

MC enters the laundry room to find Amber half-naked. After initial screaming and accusations, she asks him to come to her bedroom—she needs to talk.

> [!choice] Critical Branch: Stay or Leave
> - **Stay** → +1 Trust, unlocks Amber's confession and potential intimacy
> - **Leave** → -1 Trust, Amber is devastated ("No one ever sticks around when I need them")

### If MC Stays

Amber opens up about her insecurities. She asks why he's nice to her when everyone else treats her like "trash." MC reassures her that she's incredible, that anyone who can't see that can go to hell.

Amber then asks the question she's been building toward:

*"Do you love me, MC? But like, real love, not just sibling love. The genuine thing, the grown-up kind... between a man and a woman."*

> [!choice] Critical Branch: Amber's Love Confession
> - **Yes** → MC agrees to "figure it out together," leading to intimate scene
> - **No** → MC gently rejects her, Amber is heartbroken but releases him

### If MC Says Yes

They fall asleep together. Amber wakes first and, believing MC is asleep, begins exploring his body. MC wakes to find her on top of him.

> [!choice] Final Branch: Continue or Stop
> - **Yes (continue)** → +3 Corruption, they have their "first time" together
> - **No** → MC stops things, falls off the bed comically

---

## Part 15: Present Day — Arriving in Tokyo
### Main Story

**MC awakens on the train.** Isabella tells him they've arrived in Tokyo. He's been asleep for hours, drooling and snoring. As they disembark, MC reflects on the strange dreams—were they memories or something else?

Isabella asks about his dreams. She's curious about his past, about her mother.

> [!choice] Minor Branch: Mention Antonella
> - **Mention Antonella** → +1 Trust with Isabella, she asks innocent questions about her mother
> - **Don't mention** → Isabella is disappointed but doesn't press

As they walk through the station, MC notices a girl who looks exactly like Antonella. His medication causes reality to glitch.

> [!choice] Critical Branch: Look at the Girl
> - **Look at her** → Triggers the Birthday Flashback sequence
> - **Don't look** → Skip directly to the taxi ride

---

## Optional Part 16: Antonella's Birthday Flashback

*Only if MC chose to look at the girl*

MC's consciousness fractures. He's suddenly at a restaurant with Antonella—it's her birthday dinner. She's reserved a table for just the two of them; her parents and "friends" aren't coming.

The evening plays out like a recording, skipping forward in time. MC realizes he has no control—he's reliving a memory exactly as it happened.

During dinner, Antonella's mood shifts. Something disturbs her, but she refuses to explain. She speaks cryptically about burdens being lifted, about finally being able to breathe. MC doesn't press hard enough.

He presents her with a gift—the necklace from the clothing store. She's overcome with emotion. They kiss.

*"Even if I don't think I deserve your love,"* she says.

She asks MC to help fasten the necklace. They leave together. The memory holds the weight of things unsaid, secrets kept, a tragedy already set in motion.

**MC snaps back to the present.** Isabella is concerned—he was "frozen in time." The necklace now hangs around Isabella's neck, a gift from her late mother.

---

## Part 17: The Taxi Ride Home
### Main Story

MC and Isabella take a taxi to the family home. Isabella asks about Antonella. MC admits he never met her parents—Antonella always avoided the topic.

Isabella reveals that Grandma (Elizabeth) told her stories about her mother—that she loved to read and dressed better than Aunt Amber. MC provides carefully edited history.

Isabella mentions the living situation: the house is full. Grandma and Madison share space, Amber doesn't want to be disturbed, so they've prepared the guesthouse for MC.

She asks why he stayed away so long. MC carries the weight of his abandonment silently.

*"I became a cop to find Antonella, but all I found was a void of emptiness and self-loathing... I lost sight of who I was and turned into this hollow shell of a man."*

Isabella falls asleep in his lap. MC reflects on his failures as a father—how he hid the truth about Antonella from his daughter, how he became someone driven by hatred.

*"This time, I'm going to do better. No matter what happens."*

---

## Part 18: The Baby Revelation
### Main Story — Episode Climax

A final flashback intrudes. MC stands before his parents—Mom, Dad, and Amber—holding something unseen.

**Dad is furious.** He demands MC leave immediately. Mom tries to defend her son—he has a child now, a baby, where will he go?

*"He's made his fucking choice already,"* Dad snarls. *"If he wanted to stay here, he shouldn't have knocked up some bitch!"*

The argument escalates. Dad blames Mom for MC's failures, for not disciplining him. Mom is reduced to silence. Amber tries to intervene and is shut down.

MC meets Amber's eyes. She looks agonized. She moves close and whispers:

*"What the fuck did you do, MC? What the hell were you thinking!?"*

*"I don't know, Amber. I'm sorry. I'm so fucking sorry..."*

**The screen fades to black.**

# Thematic Elements

## Memory and Identity
MC's drug-induced flashbacks blur the line between memory and hallucination. The glitching visual effects suggest his grip on reality—and his understanding of his own past—is unstable.

## The Weight of Secrets
Antonella's repeated hints about "who she really is" and her insistence that MC would "hate her" if he knew foreshadow darker revelations to come.

## Family Dysfunction
The episode depicts a family torn by conflict: an abusive father, a mother caught between children, a sister whose love crosses boundaries, and a man running from his responsibilities.

## Love and Loss
Antonella represents something lost—perhaps forever. Her necklace, now worn by Isabella, serves as a physical reminder of absence.

---

*Episode 01 ends with MC's world shattered, his family in chaos, and a baby whose existence has changed everything. The questions multiply: Where is Antonella now? What drove MC to become a detective? And what sins from the past await in Tokyo?*

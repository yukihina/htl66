# Main Story

## Part 1: Return to Duty — Tokyo Metropolitan PD
### Main Story (Thriller)

**TIME SKIP: Three months since Elizabeth's hospitalization.**

MC reports to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's First Investigation Division (Sōsa Ikka). Chief Watanabe reviews his file with thinly veiled xenophobia:

*"Born in Tokyo. Naturalized citizenship upon joining the force. Technically Japanese. On paper."*

MC is assigned to investigate the murder of Detective Yamamoto Koji — a veteran cop found executed in his Asagaya apartment. The assignment comes from Inspector Sato of Organized Crime (Sotai), who specifically requested MC for his "Osaka connections."

> [!choice] Attitude Choice
> - **[Light]** "I'll do this right" → MC Integrity +1
> - **[Balance]** "I wasn't ready for this"
> - **[Darkness]** "Perfect. Time for payback" → MC Integrity -1

Watanabe's reasoning is clear: MC is bait. His foreign appearance might provoke yakuza reactions that a Japanese officer couldn't elicit.

*"In this department, Inspector, we utilize every tool available."*

---

## Part 2: The Shadow Directive — Antonella's Mission
### Main Story (Thriller)

**[FLASHBACK: Days Before]**

The scene shifts to a clandestine meeting between Antonella and Hiroshi Yoshida. Hiroshi assigns the hit on Yamamoto using chess metaphors:

*"You don't attack the king directly. Too obvious. Too defended. You remove his pieces. One by one."*

Yamamoto is identified as a "knight" — intelligent, mobile, dangerous. He was connecting Osaka to Tokyo operations, specifically tracking:
- Surgical modifications on female victims
- Territory shifts
- Missing women

Antonella accepts: *"Thursday night. Apartment 204. Three shots. Professional spacing."*

---

## Part 3: The Execution — Detective Yamamoto's Final Night
### Main Story (Thriller)

**[FLASHBACK: Thursday Night, 11:43 PM]**

The scene is told from Yamamoto's perspective as he works late on case files. He's tracking 17 women with surgical incisions — drug mule operations.

Five polite knocks at his door. He sees:
- Young woman, European features
- Black hair, pale skin, blue eyes with glasses
- Delivery uniform (wrong size)
- Abdominal scar visible

*"Late shift worker. Probably part-time student. Wrong apartment probably."*

He opens the door. The gun appears.

Three shots: Chest (standing) → Chest (falling) → Head (execution).

Antonella's internal monologue is cold:
*"Professional spacing. The knight falls."*
*"Wedding ring on his finger. Doesn't matter."*
*"Package. Take it. Thirty seconds. Exit clean."*

---

## Part 4: The Crime Scene — Meeting Inspector Sato
### Main Story (Thriller)

**[PRESENT DAY]**

MC arrives at Yamamoto's apartment. Inspector Takeo Sato is already there — gray-haired, wire-rim glasses, cheap suit.

*"Don't step on the chalk, [MC name]."*
*"Just Takeo. Titles are for reports. Focus is for solving cases."*

Key crime scene observations:
- **Shell casings in triangular pattern** — deliberately arranged post-kill
- **No defensive wounds** — victim opened door willingly
- **Three rapid shots** — professional execution
- **Neighbors heard "firecrackers"** — Tokyo dismisses gunshots

> [!choice] Killer Profile Choice
> - **[Light]** "They believed in justice" → MC Integrity +2
> - **[Balance]** "Just following orders"
> - **[Darkness]** "They enjoyed the kill" → MC Integrity -2

### The Drug Mule Revelation

Yamamoto's laptop reveals his investigation: **17 women over three months, Osaka to Tokyo pipeline, all with surgical incisions.**

The evidence shows degradation:
- **Victim 1**: Clean sutures, precise medical work
- **Victim 8**: Jagged edges, infection signs
- **Victim 17**: "Butchery" — torn open in panic

> [!toggle] Gore Content Warning
> Players can choose to view graphic crime scene photos or receive text descriptions.

Sato's analysis: These women weren't victims of organ harvesting. **They were walking suitcases.** The implants contained contraband (cocaine, microchips, rare earth metals).

*"If the tissue is worthless, why cut it open?"*
*"It's not about the flesh. It's about the space."*

The "surgeon" is losing his mind — the work has become sloppy. Yamamoto was killed because he found the connection between Tokyo's butcher and Osaka's supplier.

> [!choice] Moral Response Choice
> - **[Light]** "Stop them legally" → MC Integrity +2
> - **[Balance]** "Just catch them"
> - **[Darkness]** "They deserve everything" → MC Integrity -2

Sato provides context on their partnership:

*"You are a gaijin. I am... inconveniently stubborn."*
*"They put the broken tools in the basement so we don't ruin the display case."*
*"But broken tools have jagged edges. They cut deeper."*

---

## Part 5: Morning with Amber
### Main Story / NSFW (Multiple Paths)

**[NEXT MORNING]**

MC wakes to find Amber straddling him, naked. Her behavior depends on previous "strike" count (rejections):

**Initial Response Options:**
- **[Corruption]** "Show me" → Corruption path (requires 0 strikes, Amber cor ≥20)
- **[Neutral]** "You're impossible"
- **[Love]** "I missed this" → Trust +2
- **[Reject]** "Not now" → Adds strike, leads to rejection scene

### Path A: Neutral Sex Scene

Physical intimacy with dialogue choices affecting Trust/Corruption. Menu-based selection:
- Blowjob scene
- Boobjob scene
- Sex (missionary) → Creampie

Post-climax conversation references childhood memory of Amber cutting her hair.

### Path B: Corruption Path

Extreme dominant/submissive content. MC takes aggressive control:

*"You're just a collection of parts waiting for me."*

Menu-based selection requiring completion of all acts:
- Deepthroat
- Titfuck
- Assjob/grinding
- Footjob
- Full sex with degradation dialogue → Creampie

Achievement: `ep06_ach_ambcor`

### Path C: Love Path

Tender, emotional intimacy. Requires Trust ≥35:

*"You've always seen me."*
*"I see the only person who never gave up on me."*

Menu-based selection:
- Body worship
- Oral (giving)
- Sensual grinding
- Lovemaking → Creampie

Achievement: `ep06_ach_amblove`

### Path D: Rejection Scene

Amber reacts based on strike count (1, 2, or 3). Escalating emotional breakdown:

**Strike 1:** Hurt but trying to understand
**Strike 2:** Angry, accusatory
**Strike 3:** Complete emotional severance

Key dialogue (Strike 3):
*"You're not deep, [MC name]... You're just hollow."*
*"Rest in peace, [MC name]. I'm finally done visiting your grave."*

---

## Part 6: Madison's Truth Game — The Train
### Main Story (Character Development)

Madison intercepts MC before work, demanding they take the same train. Her leverage:

- **If peaceful EP05**: The sex tape from their encounter
- **If aggressive EP05**: Questions about MC's behavior

*"Because Michael taught me how the world works. And you broke the rules."*

### The Game Structure

Six rounds of questions, alternating between Madison asking MC and MC asking Madison. A lie detection system tracks dishonesty:

| Response Type | Detection Chance |
|---------------|------------------|
| Truth | 0% |
| Deflect | 50% |
| Lie | 70% |

Successful lies grant "advantage points" for harder questions. Failed lies accumulate and affect the ending.

### Critical Revelations (Round 4-5)

Madison reveals Michael's psychological conditioning:

*"Physically? Nothing. He turned on the lights."*
*"He showed me the machinery behind the marriage."*
*"Love is a scam to control women."*

On Elizabeth:
*"He pointed at her one night. Laying there, crying, fading."*
*"He told me: 'Look at her, Madison. She used to be a luxury import. Now she's just used furniture.'"*

Madison's worldview explained:
*"I decided I'd never be a tenant, not for you, not for anyone."*
*"[Mother] gave her power to a man. I take power FROM men."*

### Path Determination

Based on dialogue choices, Madison relationship develops into:
- **Love Path**: Vulnerable connection
- **Corruption Path**: Mutual darkness acknowledgment
- **Neutral Path**: Standoff maintained

---

## Part 7: Madison's Proposal — Station Platform
### Current Cliffhanger

Madison makes her final offer based on:
1. **Lies detected** (0, 1-2, or 3+)
2. **Relationship path** (Love/Corruption/Neutral)
3. **EP05 history** (peaceful or aggressive)

*"My studio's just two blocks from here."*
*"Ten minutes. Then you can go play hero."*

**Choice (Not Yet Implemented):**
- "Let's go" → Madison studio scene
- "I'm not doing this" → Rejection

# Thematic Elements

## The Chess Game
Hiroshi's chess metaphor extends through the episode:
- Yamamoto was a "knight" — eliminated
- MC is the new piece being moved onto the board
- The yakuza are playing a long game
- Each death shifts the board toward their goal

## Broken Tools
Sato's philosophy on being "broken":
- MC and Sato are both outcasts within the system
- "Broken tools have jagged edges. They cut deeper."
- Both are being used by the institution
- Their marginalization becomes their strength

## Truth vs. Lies
Madison's truth game explores:
- Everyone lies to protect themselves
- Truth is a weapon and a vulnerability
- MC's integrity is literally being tested
- Madison is trying to determine if MC is "real"

## The Walking Suitcases
The drug mule case represents:
- Women reduced to containers
- Bodies as currency in the underworld
- The degrading surgeon = system breaking down
- Antonella's victims are similar — used and discarded

---

# Mystery Elements

## New Questions Introduced
1. What was in Yamamoto's files about the Osaka-Tokyo connection?
2. Who is the "surgeon" cutting open the mules?
3. Why is the surgeon's work degrading? (Timeline pressure? Mental breakdown?)
4. What will Sato discover about the triangle pattern?

## Continuing Mysteries from Act One
- What did Elizabeth witness?
- What does the key unlock?
- Who is the police mole?
- Will Antonella kill or save MC?

---

# Connections

- Elizabeth hospitalized → MC mentions visiting for 3 months
- Michael's control → Madison explains his influence on her

## Setup for EP07:
- Autopsy results will provide new leads

- Antonella closing in on MC
- The "surgeon" must be identified

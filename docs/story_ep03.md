# Main Story
*The following sections occur regardless of player choices*

## Part 1: Awakening — The Guesthouse
### Main Story

MC awakens in the guesthouse, disoriented from the medication that continues to blur his memories with reality. He reflects bitterly on his return:

*"Being here... feels like I'm trying to fit into someone else's life that ain't mine."*

The family prospered during his absence. The new house is massive—far beyond what he remembers from childhood. This realization deepens his sense of alienation.

---

## Part 2: Isabella's Visit
### Main Story

Isabella appears at MC's bedside, concerned about his condition. She holds something in her hands—an old photograph of Antonella.

*"This was before she abandoned us."*

MC gently corrects her—they don't know what happened to Antonella. Isabella pushes back with raw pain:

*"I still don't know what I did wrong... Maybe she didn't love me?"*

MC reassures his daughter that Antonella loved her, but he cannot explain why she disappeared. He promises to always be honest with her, to always love her no matter what.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Isabella's Hug
> - **Comfort Isabella with a hug** → +3 Trust with Isabella
> - **Give a reassuring pat on the head** → +1 Trust with Isabella
>
> *The hug path includes warmer dialogue and MC calling Isabella his "lovely little princess."*

Before leaving, Isabella asks two cryptic questions:
1. *"Promise me you'll always be honest with me"*
2. *"Will you love me no matter what?"*

MC agrees, though he's troubled by the strange intensity of her requests.

---

## Part 3: The Antonella Dream
### Main Story

MC falls asleep holding Antonella's photograph. His consciousness drifts into a vivid dream where he finds himself in a field—**Antonella's tree** from Episode 01.

She's there, young and beautiful, surprised to see him. The encounter is disorienting:

- MC tells her she "disappeared" years ago
- Antonella claims she's "always been here"
- When MC mentions Isabella, Antonella says she's never been pregnant
- Reality begins to glitch and distort

Antonella offers him an impossible choice:

*"We can be happy again, can't we? Just you and me?"*

*"We'll be together forever, in a world made only for us."*

Before MC can respond, she tells him to "wake up."

> [!important] Symbolism
> The dream represents MC's fractured psyche—his desperate desire to reunite with Antonella conflicting with the reality that she left him and their daughter. The glitching effects suggest his medication (or trauma) is affecting his perception.

---

## Part 4: Late Night TV — Madison's Introduction
### Main Story

MC can't sleep after the dream. He finds himself in the living room watching television, still haunted by Antonella's memory.

Madison appears—MC's younger sister, now a young woman pursuing a modeling career like their mother. She's dressed provocatively in just underwear, completely nonchalant about her near-nudity.

MC is shocked by how much she's changed:

*"I haven't seen her in so long. But now, here she is."*

*"Since when did Madison start wearing such revealing clothing? It's like she's practically naked."*

Madison notices him watching and asks a pointed question:

*"Do you think I'm pretty?"*

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Madison's Question
> - **Admit she's attractive** → +5 Trust with Madison, leads to provocative sub-dialogue
> - **Deny finding her attractive** → Madison is disappointed, conversation ends coolly

### If MC Admits Attraction

Madison pushes further:

*"So, would you fuck me if I weren't your sister?"*

MC is disturbed by the directness. Madison claims it's "just curiosity" and seems satisfied that "men are so predictable." She leaves with a knowing smirk.

### If MC Denies

Madison becomes dismissive:

*"Men. They're all the same. Thinking with their dicks and not their brains."*

---

## Part 5: Amber's Arrival
### Main Story

As MC processes the strange encounter with Madison, Amber appears. She's been watching, waiting for Madison to leave.

*"Hi [MC]. Remember me?"*

Amber comments on Madison's behavior—claiming her younger sister "always tries to seduce someone." Then she shifts the conversation to something more personal:

*"Did you think about me, [MC]? Have you missed me?"*

> [!choice] Minor Branch: Focus
> - **Focus on Amber's breasts** → +1 Corruption with Amber (MC distracted by her cleavage)
> - **Listen to what she's saying** → +2 Trust with Amber

Amber reveals she wants to have a serious conversation about their past—about the feelings she had for MC when they were younger, and how he chose Antonella over her.

> [!note] Past Choices Matter
> The dialogue here varies significantly based on Episode 01 choices:
> - If MC confessed love to Amber (ep01_amblove): She confronts him about "breaking her heart"
> - If MC rejected Amber: She asks why he never returned her feelings
> - If MC lied to Amber about Antonella: She references the deception

---

# Major Branch: Amber's Confession

## Part 6: Listen or Dismiss
### Critical Choice

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Amber's Feelings
> - **Listen to Amber's feelings** → +5 Trust, continues to pool scene
> - **Refuse to hear her out** → -5 Trust, Amber leaves hurt
>
> *This is one of the most significant choices in the episode, determining much of the remaining content.*

---

## Branch A: Refusing Amber

If MC refuses to listen, Amber apologizes for bothering him and prepares to leave.

> [!choice] Sub-Branch: Stop Her?
> - **Stop Amber before she leaves** → Returns to main path, goes to pool
> - **Let her leave** → Amber exits, skips to photo discovery

### If Amber Leaves

The conversation ends with mutual awkwardness. MC reflects:

*"Wait... why do I care? She's always been like this, dramatic and needy."*

---

## Branch B: Listening to Amber

Amber pours out years of suppressed feelings. The dialogue varies based on Episode 01:

### If MC Confessed Love Before (ep01_amblove)

Amber confronts MC directly:

*"You lied to me, you led me on, and then you broke my heart."*

*"I even gave you my body, and you used me and said you loved me, and then you went with her."*

MC can only apologize:

*"I'm sorry for that. I really am truly sorry."*

### If MC Rejected Amber Before

Amber asks why he never saw her as anything more than a sister:

*"Every time I teased you, flirted with you, you just brushed me off like I was nothing."*

MC explains his perspective:

*"You were confused. You just thought you had feelings for me because we spent a lot of time together growing up."*

Amber refuses to accept this:

*"No, it was real. I was truly in love with you."*

---

## Part 7: Decision Point — Stay or Leave
### Branch Point

After the emotional conversation, Amber offers to continue talking:

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Amber's Invitation
> - **Tell her to stay** → +3 Trust, continues conversation
> - **Tell her to leave** → -3 Trust, Amber has emotional breakdown

### If MC Tells Amber to Leave

Amber requests a goodbye hug, which becomes uncomfortably intimate. MC pushes her away:

*"We both know you wanted more than a hug, Amber. But I can't give you that kind of affection."*

Amber leaves, hurt but composed.

### Rejection Path — Amber's Breakdown

If MC has consistently rejected Amber through the episode, she explodes:

*"You abandoned me when I needed you the most, and you never looked back."*

*"You were that little branch I was holding on to when I was drowning, and you decided to take that away from me and give it to a ghost... a fucking ghost."*

*"I hope you have a miserable life just like I have all these years without you."*

> [!warning] Relationship Damage
> This path severely damages the relationship with Amber (-5 Trust) and sets up future conflict.

---

## Part 8: The Pool — Continuing Together
### Main Story (If MC Stayed With Amber)

Amber leads MC to the backyard pool. He's still adjusting to the family's new wealth:

*"Seriously, where did they get the money for all this? I would never have believed we were so rich."*

Amber deflects his suspicions:

*"Stop it, [MC]. You're always so paranoid. Not everything is a police case for you to solve."*

They share a moment of levity, with MC complimenting her tattoos:

*"They're pretty badass. Looks good on your type of body... tall, voluptuous."*

*"A metal goddess."*

### The Glitch

MC's medication causes reality to fracture. He sees Amber as she was when they were teenagers:

*"Your clothes, your face, everything, it's all the same. Like you're frozen in time."*

He becomes dizzy and loses consciousness, falling into the pool.

### The Rescue

Amber dives in after him, pulling his unconscious body from the water:

*"I'm not losing you, not again!"*

*"Come on, come on! Don't die, you idiot!"*

She drags him back to his room, strips off both their wet clothes to prevent hypothermia, and falls asleep holding him.

---

## Part 9: Madison's Discovery
### Conditional Scene

If MC **did not lock the door** before sleeping with Amber, Madison discovers them together:

*"What the hell is this? Are they... fucking or something?"*

Madison's internal monologue reveals her contempt:

*"So that's why he was prancing around in his boxers... What an asshole..."*

*"Undressing me with his eyes... what a bastard."*

*"And now banging that fat old slut!"*

*"This info will be useful. Sweet dreams... until I make your lives a living hell."*

> [!warning] Future Consequences
> Madison witnessing MC and Amber together sets up potential blackmail or family drama in future episodes.

---

# Branch: Morning Intimacy

## Part 10: Waking Up Together
### Main Story (If MC Stayed With Amber)

MC awakens to find himself naked with Amber asleep beside him—also naked. Her breasts are directly in his face.

Amber wakes and explains she stripped them both to keep him warm after the pool accident. Things become awkward as they realize their proximity.

> [!choice] Branch Point: Amber's Departure
> - **Invite Amber to spend the night** → +3 Trust, continues to morning scene
> - **Let Amber leave** → Scene ends, skips to photo discovery

### If MC Invites Amber to Stay

They share the bed. MC chooses whether to lock the door (affecting whether Madison catches them).

---

## Part 11: Morning — The Groping Path
### Main Story (Morning After Staying Together)

MC wakes before Amber. Her body is exposed, the blanket having shifted during the night.

> [!choice] Critical Branch Point: Morning Decision
> - **Grope Amber** → Initiates potential sexual content, but risky
> - **Cover Amber up** → Respectful path, skips to photo discovery

### Branch: Groping Amber

MC gives in to temptation, beginning to touch Amber while she sleeps. He removes her panties.

Amber wakes—but her reaction depends on **Episode 01 choices**:

### If MC Had Sex With Amber Before (ep01_first)

Amber is surprisingly receptive:

*"You don't have to say anything, I know what you did."*

*"Let me get rid of this [clothing], so you can enjoy the view even more."*

*"We're adults now, [MC]. I want this. I've wanted this for so fucking long."*

> [!choice] Sexual Content Path
> Multiple choices determine the nature of the encounter:
> - **Titjob** vs **Skip to pussy play**
> - **Respect her "no penetration" boundary** vs **Insist/Force**
> - **Respect her boundaries during foreplay** vs **Penetrate anyway**

### If MC Did NOT Have Sex With Amber Before

Amber reacts with fury:

*"WHAT THE FUCK, [MC]?! ARE YOU FUCKING--??!!"*

*"You tried to rape me while I was asleep?!?"*

She storms out, severely damaging the relationship.

---

## Sexual Outcomes Summary

| Path | Result | Relationship Impact |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Respect all boundaries | Successful intimate scene (no penetration) | +5 Trust, +2 Corruption |
| Insist on penetration | Amber refuses, leaves angry | -5 Trust |
| Force penetration | Amber screams, leaves furious | -5 Trust, "violated trust" |
| Never had sex before + grope | Amber accuses rape, leaves | Major damage |

### Best Outcome

If MC respects Amber's boundaries throughout, the scene ends tenderly:

*"I think I still love you, [MC]..."*

*"Thank you for respecting my decision and not pushing any further."*

*"Maybe next time we can get that condom and go all the way. Or perhaps you can use my backdoor?"*

---

## Part 12: Getting Clothes — Madison Encounter

---

## Part 13: The Photoshoot — Cutaway Scene

The scene reveals family dynamics:
- Elizabeth is patient but strict
- Madison is frustrated and jealous of Isabella
- Isabella is sweet but uses Grandma's phone to text MC

This scene provides context for why Isabella has photos on Elizabeth's phone and sets up Madison's resentment.

---

> *"Don't forget to check the boxes from Osaka! I packed some special surprises for you!"*

---

## Part 15: The Boxes — Episode Climax
### Main Story

MC retrieves the boxes Isabella packed from his Osaka apartment. Inside, he finds something unexpected—a photograph.

It's him and Antonella, taken years ago during their last summer together. The photo shows them happy, in love—before everything fell apart.

*"I remember taking this picture, but I never knew it still existed..."*

*"That moment was so perfect... So full of love and hope..."*

*"She already had Isabella in her belly, but no one knew about it yet. Not even us."*

### The Revelation

MC realizes something crucial—this photo wasn't his:

*"This photo belongs to someone else."*

*"The only one who could have had this picture would be... Antonella."*

> [!important] Mystery Deepens

# Thematic Elements

## Home as Foreign Territory
MC returns to a family home he doesn't recognize—new house, new wealth, new dynamics. He's an outsider in his own family, struggling to find his place.

## Unfinished Business
Amber represents years of unresolved tension. Whether MC addresses it directly or continues avoiding it shapes the episode's emotional core.

## Watching and Being Watched
Madison establishes herself as an observer, gathering information. Her discovery of MC and Amber together creates future leverage.

## Past and Present Collide
The discovered photograph of Antonella pierces MC's careful separation between his past and present. She's not as far away as he thought.

---

# Mystery Elements

## The Photograph
How did a photograph that belonged to Antonella end up in boxes packed from MC's Osaka apartment? Possibilities:
- Isabella found it while packing (but where?)
- Someone planted it deliberately
- Antonella had contact with MC's belongings
- The mysterious woman from Episode 02 is involved

## Madison's Agenda
Madison's behavior is calculating and provocative. Is she simply testing boundaries, or does she have a specific goal?

## The Family's Wealth
MC notes repeatedly that the family's new wealth doesn't make sense. Where did the money come from? Amber dismisses his concerns, but his detective instincts are triggered.

---

*Episode 03 ends with MC holding a photograph from his past, a reminder that Antonella isn't just a memory—she's a mystery still unfolding. As he stares at the image of their last happy moment together, one question burns: How did this get here?*

"E05INTRO_d002": "At least the kitchen's empty. Small mercies.",
"E05INTRO_d003": "Where did [mo_r] hide the coffee this time?",
"E05INTRO_d004": "Found it. Behind the wine bottles. Classic Elizabeth.",
"E05INTRO_d005": "Could've used something stronger than coffee after yesterday...",
"E05INTRO_d006": "The sun's pretty nice today though. Maybe I should...",
"E05INTRO_d007": "Perfect. Coffee by the pool sounds good right now.",
"E05INTRO_d008": "Might help clear my head after all.",
"E05INTRO_d009": "What could possibly go wrong with a quiet morning coffee?",

"E05MADYOG_d000": "Oh, by the way - remember getting her drunk that night?",
"E05MADYOG_d001": "Okay, like this... smooth and gentle. Feel the stretch in your core.",
"E05MADYOG_d002": "Wow, you're amazing at this, Maddie! I wish I could move like that...",
"E05MADYOG_d003": "It just takes practice, sweetie. Stay with me and you'll get there.",
"E05MADYOG_d004": "I'll make sure you learn everything you need.",
"E05MADYOG_d005": "The secret is in the details. Watch how I position myself.",
"E05MADYOG_d006": "Um... I-Is this actually yoga? It looks different from the videos...",
"E05MADYOG_d007": "Trust your best friend, Nanami. I've been doing this way longer than those YouTube wannabes.",
"E05MADYOG_d008": "Besides, this is... a special kind of practice.",
"E05MADYOG_d009": "Now we stretch a little... wider.",
"E05MADYOG_d010": "M-Maddison! Are you sure?",
"E05MADYOG_d011": "Relax. Nobody's watching but me.",
"E05MADYOG_d012": "See how liberating this is?",
"E05MADYOG_d013": "It looks... intense.",
"E05MADYOG_d014": "You'll see how good it feels soon enough.",
"E05MADYOG_d015": "Want to give it a shot? I'll help you get into position.",
"E05MADYOG_d016": "I don't know... what if I fall over?",
"E05MADYOG_d017": "I won't let that happen. I've got you.",
"E05MADYOG_d018": "Always.",
"E05MADYOG_d019": "Eeeeh... Maddie... these clothes feel really tight...",
"E05MADYOG_d020": "They're supposed to be. Shows off your beautiful curves perfectly.",
"E05MADYOG_d021": "But everyone can see everything!",
"E05MADYOG_d022": "That's the whole point, silly.",
"E05MADYOG_d023": "Besides, it's just us here...",
"E05MADYOG_d024": "Here, let me help you get the position right...",
"E05MADYOG_d025": "M-Maddie... this is so embarrassing... what if someone sees?",
"E05MADYOG_d026": "Stop thinking so much. Just feel it.",
"E05MADYOG_d027": "Focus on my hands guiding you...",
"E05MADYOG_d028": "Let's see what you've got.",
"E05MADYOG_d029": "But I'm not ready...",
"E05MADYOG_d030": "You never are, and that's why it's fun.",
"E05MADYOG_d031": "Perfect form, Nanami. You're such a natural.",
"E05MADYOG_d032": "R-really? Thank you so much, Maddie!",
"E05MADYOG_d033": "Of course. You know I only want what's best for you.",
"E05MADYOG_d034": "We're going to get even closer...",
"E05MADYOG_d035": "Just need to adjust a few things...",
"E05MADYOG_d036": "Here... and here... feels good, right?",
"E05MADYOG_d037": "Y-yes... I think so...",
"E05MADYOG_d038": "Am I doing this correctly, Maddie?",
"E05MADYOG_d039": "Mmm... almost there. Just a bit more...",
"E05MADYOG_d040": "You're so responsive to my touch...",
"E05MADYOG_d041": "Your skin's gotten so soft lately...",
"E05MADYOG_d042": "I've been using that special lotion you bought me! Every night, just like you said!",
"E05MADYOG_d043": "Such a good girl... following all my instructions.",
"E05MADYOG_d044": "Now bring those legs closer together... trust me.",
"E05MADYOG_d045": "But the yoga book shows it differently...",
"E05MADYOG_d046": "Forget the book. This way feels much better, doesn't it?",
"E05MADYOG_d047": "I-is this the right position, Maddie?",
"E05MADYOG_d048": "You're such a perfect student... so eager to please...",
"E05MADYOG_d049": "Let me reward you...",
"E05MADYOG_d050": "This next pose needs special attention...",
"E05MADYOG_d051": "M-Madison! That's not... we shouldn't...",
"E05MADYOG_d052": "Shh... just relax. Let me take care of everything.",
"E05MADYOG_d053": "You know I only want what's best for you...",
"E05MADYOG_d054": "You're acting strange today...",
"E05MADYOG_d055": "Am I? Or are you just scared of getting closer to me?",
"E05MADYOG_d056": "I... I don't understand what you mean...",
"E05MADYOG_d057": "You will. Soon.",
"E05MADYOG_d058": "Now... copy my movements exactly, okay?",
"E05MADYOG_d059": "Like this? Am I doing okay?",
"E05MADYOG_d060": "Perfect. Can you feel how connected we are?",
"E05MADYOG_d061": "This is how it should always be...",
"E05MADYOG_d062": "You're mine to protect... to guide... to cherish.",
"E05MADYOG_d063": "Maddie... you're being intense again...",
"E05MADYOG_d064": "Let's take things further. You trust me, right?",
"E05MADYOG_d065": "I'll show you things you've never imagined...",
"E05MADYOG_d066": "Whatever they're doing... it's not my business. Better leave them alone.",
"E05MADYOG_d067": "Madison would just start another fight anyway...",
"E05MADYOG_d068": "And I really need my morning coffee...",
"E05MADYOG_d069": "Something's definitely wrong here. Madison's acting weird...",
"E05MADYOG_d070": "I should check on Nanami. This doesn't look right.",
"E05MADYOG_d071": "Hey... what's going on out here?",
"E05MADYOG_d072": "[mc_name]! It's not what it looks like! Maddie's teaching me some morning stretches!",
"E05MADYOG_d073": "We're in the middle of something. Get lost, pervert.",
"E05MADYOG_d074": "Teaching? That looked more like groping to me.",
"E05MADYOG_d075": "Nobody asked for your opinion.",
"E05MADYOG_d076": "It's a special technique Maddie invented! Right, Maddie?",
"E05MADYOG_d077": "Ignore him, Nanami. He's just jealous he can't join in.",
"E05MADYOG_d078": "Men always want to ruin everything...",
"E05MADYOG_d079": "Keep going sweetie, you're doing so well.",
"E05MADYOG_d080": "O-okay, Maddie! If you say so...",
"E05MADYOG_d081": "That's my girl. So obedient...",
"E05MADYOG_d082": "Let me handle this asshole. Don't stop practicing.",
"E05MADYOG_d083": "Uhm... please don't fight...",
"E05MADYOG_d084": "Just a quick chat between siblings. Right, [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05MADYOG_d085": "Seriously, what's your problem now?",
"E05MADYOG_d086": "Can't you see we're busy here? Go jerk off somewhere else.",
"E05MADYOG_d087": "Cut the act. That's not yoga and you know it.",
"E05MADYOG_d088": "Oh? And what exactly do you think it is?",
"E05MADYOG_d089": "You're manipulating her. She trusts you and you're taking advantage.",
"E05MADYOG_d090": "Aww, is big [br_full_r_low] playing white knight now? How noble.",
"E05MADYOG_d091": "Don't pretend you weren't enjoying the show, pervert.",
"E05MADYOG_d092": "I'm not a pervert. Just looking out for her.",
"E05MADYOG_d093": "Right. Because creeping on young girls is totally normal...",
"E05MADYOG_d094": "What are you talking about?",
"E05MADYOG_d095": "Look at you... acting all righteous while undressing her with your eyes.",
"E05MADYOG_d096": "You're just like every other man - thinking with your dick.",
"E05MADYOG_d097": "What the hell are you talking about?",
"E05MADYOG_d098": "Don't play dumb. It's pathetic.",
"E05MADYOG_d099": "I see everything in this house, remember? Every little interaction...",
"E05MADYOG_d100": "I barely know her! We've only talked like twice!",
"E05MADYOG_d101": "Always excuses with you men, isn't it?",
"E05MADYOG_d102": "You know who you remind me of right now?",
"E05MADYOG_d103": "Dear old [daddy_r]. King of excuses himself.",
"E05MADYOG_d104": "Madison-",
"E05MADYOG_d105": "Wonder what he's doing in his office right now? More 'late night surgeries'?",
"E05MADYOG_d106": "I don't care what he does.",
"E05MADYOG_d107": "Of course not. Because we don't care what anyone does in this [fm_r_low], do we?",
"E05MADYOG_d108": "What does he have to do with you basically molesting Nanami?",
"E05MADYOG_d109": "'Molesting'? Please. I'm helping her grow.",
"E05MADYOG_d110": "Teaching her confidence. Something you wouldn't understand.",
"E05MADYOG_d111": "That wasn't confidence - it was control.",
"E05MADYOG_d112": "And? What's wrong with that? Let me tell you a story, dear [br_full_r_low].",
"E05MADYOG_d113": "About a little redhead who learned life's hardest lesson...",
"E05MADYOG_d114": "Madison, I just want my coffee.",
"E05MADYOG_d115": "You'll listen whether you like it or not.",
"E05MADYOG_d116": "Once upon a time, there was a girl who lived in a big house.",
"E05MADYOG_d117": "She thought it was her castle, but it was more like a cage.",
"E05MADYOG_d118": "She watched her [mo_r] get slapped around every night. When she tried to help? Guess what happened?",
"E05MADYOG_d119": "She got slapped, too.",
"E05MADYOG_d120": "Madison, stop—",
"E05MADYOG_d121": "No interrupting! Stories have rules.",
"E05MADYOG_d122": "[mo_r] called her a nuisance. Told her to go away.",
"E05MADYOG_d123": "Why are you telling me this?",
"E05MADYOG_d124": "Because you need to understand why things are this way.",
"E05MADYOG_d125": "That good little girl? She died that night. Learned something important.",
"E05MADYOG_d126": "Being good gets you hurt. Being bad? That's how you survive.",
"E05MADYOG_d127": "I had no idea...",
"E05MADYOG_d128": "You like her, don't you? Our precious little Nanami...",
"E05MADYOG_d129": "Don't worry. I like her too. Different kind of like though.",
"E05MADYOG_d130": "It's not like that at all...",
"E05MADYOG_d131": "Just look at her... so pure, so innocent.",
"E05MADYOG_d132": "What do you see when you look at her? Nice tits? Cute face? Bet you've thought about it...",
"E05MADYOG_d133": "I don't-",
"E05MADYOG_d134": "Shut up. We both know that's exactly what you see.",
"E05MADYOG_d135": "Want to know what I see? Everything. The girl crying in bathroom stalls.",
"E05MADYOG_d136": "The one apologizing for breathing. My precious little Nanami...",
"E05MADYOG_d137": "She's grown so much with me, but inside? Still that scared bunny. She needs me.",
"E05MADYOG_d138": "Want to hear how we met? It's quite the story.",
"E05MADYOG_d139": "Do I have a choice in this?",
"E05MADYOG_d140": "Found her locked in the school bathroom. Crying her eyes out.",
"E05MADYOG_d141": "Called her pathetic, slapped her, told her to grow up. She looked at me like I'd kicked a puppy. It was adorable.",
"E05MADYOG_d142": "That's... horrible.",
"E05MADYOG_d143": "Next day? Her bullies vanished. One got expelled. Others... learned their lesson.",
"E05MADYOG_d144": "What did you do to them?",
"E05MADYOG_d145": "Protected what's mine. She's been following me ever since.",
"E05MADYOG_d146": "Like a lost puppy finding its owner...",
"E05MADYOG_d147": "You're not ruining this. She needs me. She belongs to me.",
"E05MADYOG_d148": "Get it through your thick skull, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05MADYOG_d149": "She's not your property!",
"E05MADYOG_d150": "Oh please. Like you know anything about her.",
"E05MADYOG_d151": "Look at you playing hero. It's honestly pathetic.",
"E05MADYOG_d152": "You don't know the first thing about her. Just projecting your sick fantasies.",
"E05MADYOG_d153": "That's bullshit! You're the one who's sick!",
"E05MADYOG_d154": "Am I? You think she needs you? That she sees you the way you see her?",
"E05MADYOG_d155": "I'm her everything. Her protector. Her confidante. Her salvation.",
"E05MADYOG_d156": "Do you even know what it feels like to be with a woman?",
"E05MADYOG_d157": "Are we really having this conversation?",
"E05MADYOG_d158": "Look at her... all you see is eye candy. But I see her soul.",
"E05MADYOG_d159": "You're sick for even suggesting that.",
"E05MADYOG_d160": "No, [br_full_r_low]. You're the sick one. This is real love. Pure love.",
"E05MADYOG_d161": "Not your twisted male fantasy version of it.",
"E05MADYOG_d162": "This is why women are superior. We see the whole picture.",
"E05MADYOG_d163": "Your dick only sees half the story. We see love in its purest form.",
"E05MADYOG_d164": "That's what makes us more human than you'll ever be.",
"E05MADYOG_d165": "Jesus Christ... I just wanted some breakfast.",
"E05MADYOG_d166": "I'm out of here.",
"E05MADYOG_d167": "Running away? Typical man.",
"E05MADYOG_d168": "That's right. Leave. Men never want to face reality.",
"E05MADYOG_d169": "This is exactly why Nanami needs someone like me.",
"E05MADYOG_d170": "Someone who'll stay. Who'll protect her.",
"E05MADYOG_d171": "Oh, by the way - remember keeping her up late that night?",
"E05MADYOG_d172": "She told me everything. 'Maddie, your [br_full_r_low] touched me...'",
"E05MADYOG_d173": "Nobody touches what's mine. Remember that.",
"E05MADYOG_d174": "Go fuck yourself!",
"E05MADYOG_d175": "Oh look! Perfect timing - Nanami's shower time!",
"E05MADYOG_d176": "Nanami! Ready for your morning routine?",
"E05MADYOG_d177": "Don't forget to use that special soap I got you...",
"E05MADYOG_d178": "Thanks for the amazing lesson, Maddie! It was really fun!",
"E05MADYOG_d179": "Anything for you, sweetie.",
"E05MADYOG_d180": "I'm gonna go shower now, okay?",
"E05MADYOG_d181": "Go ahead.",
"E05MADYOG_d182": "Now then, dear [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05MADYOG_d183": "Let's discuss keeping secrets, shall we?",
"E05MADYOG_d184": "[fm_r] secrets are the best kind...",
"E05MADYOG_d185": "What are you-",
"E05MADYOG_d186": "Shh... just taking a little insurance policy.",
"E05MADYOG_d187": "Say cheese, big [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05MADYOG_d188": "Behave, or everyone sees this lovely topless pic of me with their favorite pervert.",
"E05MADYOG_d189": "Wonder what Nanami or Isabella would think?",
"E05MADYOG_d190": "Delete that right now!",
"E05MADYOG_d191": "Not happening. Be a good boy and maybe I won't share them.",
"E05MADYOG_d192": "Your reputation is in my hands now...",
"E05MADYOG_d193": "Perfect blackmail material...",
"E05MADYOG_d194": "Have fun dying alone, [br_full_r_low] dear.",
"E05MADYOG_d195": "Now if you'll excuse me, Nanami needs help washing her back...",
"E05MADYOG_d196": "Now that Nanami is gone, don't forget you owe me a favor. Remember the photo, right? We'll talk later.",

"E05AMBERCOF_d001": "Coffee time.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d002": "Always right after her streams...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d003": "Stream's done?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d004": "Just finished. Gonna chill now.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d005": "She seems less aggressive than usual...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d006": "Maybe I should say something about last time...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d007": "She looks tired... might be a good moment.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d008": "Maybe I should try to make things right...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d009": "About last time...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d010": "Save it. I don't do apologies.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d011": "Classic Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d012": "I was wrong.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d013": "Yeah, you were. Don't do it again.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d014": "... but thanks for saying it.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d015": "Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d016": "You're blocking the coffee maker.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d017": "Guess she's still mad...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d018": "The tension is unbearable...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d019": "[da_r]? Can you come to my room? I need to talk to you...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d020": "Saved by Isabella...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d021": "You look tense. Madison giving you trouble?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d022": "No more than usual. Just... dealing with things.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d023": "She's such a little bitch sometimes...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d024": "Hmm.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d025": "Want to talk about it?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d026": "I'm just realizing how little control we really have. Even when we try to do what's right.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d027": "That's deep for a morning chat.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d028": "Yeah. Just thinking aloud.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d029": "You always overthink everything...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d030": "Well, don't think too hard. Life's easier that way.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d031": "I'll keep that in mind.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d032": "Let me help you forget all that crap...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d033": "Want me to help you relax?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d034": "I've got just the thing.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d035": "What do you mean?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d036": "Let's just say, it'll take your mind off things.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d037": "Here? Someone could-",
"E05AMBERCOF_d038": "That's what makes it fun.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d039": "Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d040": "Scared someone will see us?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d041": "Or that you won't be able to stop yourself?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d042": "We shouldn't be doing this... at least not here or even at this time...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d043": "No? Then why are you watching me so closely?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d044": "She's got a point...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d045": "Like what you see?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d046": "Nervous?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d047": "Or excited?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d048": "Someone could come in any second...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d049": "Mmm...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d050": "Like Madison? Or sweet little Isabella?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d051": "You know... The risk is half the fun.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d052": "Where do you want it?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d053": "Upstairs? My room?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d054": "Amber... we can't...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d055": "This is crazy... but...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d056": "Alright.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d057": "That's what I like to hear...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d058": "You're going to get us in trouble...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d059": "We really shouldn't...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d060": "We can't keep doing this, Amber.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d061": "Fine. Be boring.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d062": "Whatever. I just wanted coffee anyway.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d063": "She's really upset...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d064": "[da_r]? Can you come to my room? I need to talk to you...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d065": "Shhh... wouldn't want anyone hearing...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d066": "We shouldn't-",
"E05AMBERCOF_d067": "Stop thinking so much...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d068": "Shut up and watch me.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d069": "She's so demanding...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d070": "I know you want to...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d071": "Does this catch your eye?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d072": "Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d073": "Just say yes...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d074": "I can feel how much you want this...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d075": "We shouldn't...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d076": "But we will...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d077": "Shouldn't what? This?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d078": "Someone could walk in...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d079": "Scared? Or turned on?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d080": "Then we better make it quick...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d081": "Come here...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d082": "Fuck... you're so wet...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d083": "All for you, big [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d084": "The way she says that...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d085": "Now, do it! Quick!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d086": "You want me to...?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d087": "Fuck me!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d088": "Stop teasing and put it in already...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d089": "So impatient...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d090": "Please... I need it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d091": "Just the tip? Really?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d092": "You like it slow... right?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d093": "Fuck slow, I want all of it!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d094": "Stop being gentle...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d095": "Make me...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d096": "You asked for it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d097": "Tell me how good it feels...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d098": "So fucking good...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d099": "Harder... fuck me harder!",

"E05AMBERCOF_d103": "Don't stop... please don't stop...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d104": "Right there... yes!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d105": "You feel amazing...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d106": "Keep going... just like that...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d107": "You're so tight...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d108": "All yours... I'm all yours...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d109": "Keep fucking me...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d110": "She's getting close...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d111": "Don't you dare slow down...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d112": "I'm close...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d113": "Me too...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d114": "Together... let's cum together...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d115": "Yes! Just like that!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d116": "Amber... I can't hold it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d117": "Don't hold back... give it to me...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d118": "You're squeezing me so tight...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d119": "I'm gonna cum... gonna cum...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d120": "Fuck yes! Don't stop!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d121": "So close...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d122": "Me too... me too...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d123": "Wait! Wait! Wait!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d124": "What!!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d125": "You know what would be fun? Giving my coffee a special... creamer.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d126": "That's...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d127": "Perverted? That's the point.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d128": "But...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d129": "Shut up and do it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d130": "Come for me, big [br_full_r_low].",
"E05AMBERCOF_d131": "Do it.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d132": "You're crazy...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d133": "Oh god...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d134": "Come on, give my coffee what it needs...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d135": "This girl is unbelievable...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d136": "You're fucking insane, you know that?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d137": "You love it though...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d138": "God help me, I do...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d139": "Fuck, fuck, fuck!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d140": "Yes... give it all to me...",

"E05AMBERCOF_d142": "That's it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d143": "Holy shit...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d144": "Perfect...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d145": "Now that's a proper drink.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d146": "She's really going to...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d147": "Cheers...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d148": "She's actually stirring it in...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d149": "The perfect blend...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d150": "You're something else...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d151": "Mmm... much better than the store-bought stuff.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d152": "You're insane.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d153": "You mean creative...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d154": "You love it. So, feeling better now?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d155": "Yeah... yeah, actually.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d156": "Told you I'd help...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d157": "Yummy!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d158": "Best coffee I've had all week...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d159": "The way she licks her lips...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d160": "Alright! Now just let me fix my clothes...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d161": "That was intense...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d162": "What, getting shy now after all that?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d163": "We really need to be careful...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d164": "What's life without a little risk?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d165": "Finally got to swallow instead of wearing it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d166": "Jesus, Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d167": "By the way, for future reference, I can swallow but never ever do it on my face. It's just a pain to clean up.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d168": "Good to know.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d169": "Good to know.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d170": "Let's clean this jizz before I go.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d171": "Well, that's my morning pick-me-up done. Better than caffeine, right?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d172": "Yeah... thanks, Amber.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d173": "Anytime, big [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d174": "Oh, by the way - Elizabeth's been popping pills again. More than usual.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d175": "How do you know?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d176": "She's not exactly subtle...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d177": "Hard to miss the rattling when she walks by. Plus Isabella's been hovering around her door like a concerned little nurse.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d178": "Isabella?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d179": "Your [dau_r_low] notices more than you think...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d180": "Yeah, she's got quite the observation skills.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d181": "Just like her [mo_full_r_low]...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d182": "Better keep an eye on both of them...",

"E05ISACOS_d001": "Let's go in, [da_r]. I need to show you something important.",
"E05ISACOS_d002": "She never asks me to her room...",
"E05ISACOS_d003": "Please hurry, it's about [gra_r]...",
"E05ISACOS_d004": "Isabella, it's me... [mc_name]",
"E05ISACOS_d005": "Come in, [da_r]. I've been wanting to talk to you.",
"E05ISACOS_d006": "She sounds worried...",
"E05ISACOS_d007": "Lock the door, [daddy_r]. What we need to discuss should stay private.",
"E05ISACOS_d008": "What's on your mind?",
"E05ISACOS_d009": "She's never this secretive...",
"E05ISACOS_d010": "About [gra_r] Elizabeth. I've been watching her, studying her behavior...",
"E05ISACOS_d011": "What about her?",
"E05ISACOS_d012": "I've seen the bottles in her room, [da_r]. So many pills... different colors, different names.",
"E05ISACOS_d013": "Her pills? What do you mean?",
"E05ISACOS_d014": "It's just... you weren't here, [da_r]. These past few years have been rough. [grf_short_r] keeps giving her all these pills, saying they'll help, but...",
"E05ISACOS_d015": "Some days she's like a zombie, just sitting there. And when she skips them, she's either crying or throwing up in the bathroom.",
"E05ISACOS_d016": "Uhm...",
"E05ISACOS_d017": "I think she needs to see another doctor, [da_r]. Someone who actually wants to help her get better.",
"E05ISACOS_d018": "Because honestly? It feels like [grf_short_r]'s just playing around with her meds.",
"E05ISACOS_d019": "Every time she starts feeling better, he gives her more stuff until she's worse than before.",
"E05ISACOS_d020": "Michael... what are you doing to her?",
"E05ISACOS_d021": "I'm gonna talk to her about this.",
"E05ISACOS_d022": "Thanks, [daddy_r]. Let's keep an eye on her, okay?",
"E05ISACOS_d023": "I'm scared something bad might happen...",
"E05ISACOS_d024": "Okay, Sweetheart. Changing the subject, can I ask what you are doing?",
"E05ISACOS_d025": "What do you mean, [daddy_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d026": "Your clothes... is that lingerie?",
"E05ISACOS_d027": "Oh... this? It's the base layer for Commander White's outfit.",
"E05ISACOS_d028": "Commander who?",
"E05ISACOS_d029": "At least it's for cosplay...",
"E05ISACOS_d030": "From NieR:Automata! You know, the beautiful commander with white hair?",
"E05ISACOS_d031": "Still... isn't it a bit revealing for a base layer?",
"E05ISACOS_d032": "Even if it's accurate, it's too much...",
"E05ISACOS_d033": "But it has to be exact! Her outfit is all about the details...",
"E05ISACOS_d034": "No, I don't like it... it's still inappropriate.",
"E05ISACOS_d035": "The Commander's outfit wasn't this revealing, was it?",
"E05ISACOS_d036": "But [daddy_r], her uniform needs this foundation! The structure is important.",
"E05ISACOS_d037": "See the regal-style lace? It's specifically designed for her look.",
"E05ISACOS_d038": "Well... It looks regal... I think so, but please tell me there's more to the costume.",
"E05ISACOS_d039": "Of course! We still need the coat, boots, and everything else!",
"E05ISACOS_d040": "Commander White's uniform is really complex. All these pieces have to go on in the right order.",
"E05ISACOS_d041": "Oh thank god. For a moment there, Sweetheart, you had me worried.",
"E05ISACOS_d042": "Still... seeing you in something so mature, it just reminded me that you're growing up, and it's just... strange, that's all.",
"E05ISACOS_d043": "Shhh... Don't say that, [da_r]. You're making me blush...",
"E05ISACOS_d044": "I'll always be your little girl. No matter what...",
"E05ISACOS_d045": "Why does that sound different now...",
"E05ISACOS_d046": "Hey... could you help me with something? I need help getting dressed properly.",
"E05ISACOS_d047": "The costume's not done yet... there are some parts I can't reach...",
"E05ISACOS_d048": "What's missing, Sweetheart?",
"E05ISACOS_d049": "Can't you tell? Look closer...",
"E05ISACOS_d050": "Uhmm... nope?",
"E05ISACOS_d051": "Well... Look carefully and tell me what's missing! The character always wears specific accessories...",
"E05ISACOS_d052": "Uhmm...",
"E05ISACOS_d053": "She's waiting for an answer... what should I do?",
"E05ISACOS_d054": "Something's still not right though. Can you tell what it is, [da_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d055": "The... uhm... the bottom part looks incomplete...",
"E05ISACOS_d056": "Focus on the costume, not my body...",
"E05ISACOS_d057": "Look carefully, [daddy_r]. The character wears something special over this...",
"E05ISACOS_d058": "Feel how exposed the lace is? It needs something over it, right?",
"E05ISACOS_d059": "Her body's looks so fragile...",
"E05ISACOS_d060": "Think fashion, [da_r]. What covers but still shows skin?",
"E05ISACOS_d061": "A jacket?",
"E05ISACOS_d062": "Please let that be the right answer...",
"E05ISACOS_d063": "Yes! And thigh-high boots too! Will you help me put them on?",
"E05ISACOS_d064": "Sure, just tell me what to do.",
"E05ISACOS_d065": "At least we're getting somewhere safe...",
"E05ISACOS_d066": "Running away, [daddy_r]? When I need your help most...",
"E05ISACOS_d067": "Can't you tell how excited I am to show you? My heart's racing...",
"E05ISACOS_d068": "She's being too forward...",
"E05ISACOS_d069": "Isabella, this isn't-",
"E05ISACOS_d070": "Just help me with Commander White's jacket. That's all I want...",
"E05ISACOS_d071": "I should go...",
"E05ISACOS_d072": "The uniform needs that military jacket, [daddy_r]... to complete the look.",
"E05ISACOS_d073": "That's not appropriate...",
"E05ISACOS_d074": "Why not? I picked this costume specially for you...",
"E05ISACOS_d075": "Please? You owe me at least this much. Remember how you never helped me dress up in the past?",
"E05ISACOS_d076": "You know I can't say no when you look at me like that.",
"E05ISACOS_d077": "When did she learn to be so manipulative...",
"E05ISACOS_d078": "D-[daddy_r_low]... what are you...",
"E05ISACOS_d079": "The regal details on this lace are interesting...",
"E05ISACOS_d080": "She wasn't expecting this...",
"E05ISACOS_d081": "Wait... your hands...",
"E05ISACOS_d082": "Commander White's uniform needs careful inspection...",
"E05ISACOS_d083": "I... um... you're being different...",
"E05ISACOS_d084": "That's not... I mean... you're so close...",
"E05ISACOS_d085": "The base layer is quite revealing...",
"E05ISACOS_d086": "I didn't expect you to... notice so much...",
"E05ISACOS_d087": "[daddy_r], you're making me nervous...",
"E05ISACOS_d088": "The jacket will cover all this, right?",
"E05ISACOS_d089": "Her skin's burning under my touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d090": "Y-yes! The military jacket! It's over there...",
"E05ISACOS_d091": "Should I... get it?",
"E05ISACOS_d092": "Let me help you into it.",
"E05ISACOS_d093": "Okay, [da_r]... Let me get it.",
"E05ISACOS_d094": "She's still nervous from my touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d095": "Right... the jacket...",
"E05ISACOS_d096": "Okay, I got it. It's heavier than I expected...",
"E05ISACOS_d097": "Please, [daddy_r]? The shoulders are structured...",
"E05ISACOS_d098": "Focus on helping her with the uniform...",
"E05ISACOS_d099": "How should I help with this...",
"E05ISACOS_d100": "Hold it open for me... it's pretty stiff...",
"E05ISACOS_d101": "The details on this are impressive...",
"E05ISACOS_d102": "The shoulders need to sit just right...",
"E05ISACOS_d103": "At least this is covering more skin...",
"E05ISACOS_d104": "Like this? The shoulders look even now.",
"E05ISACOS_d105": "Yes... perfect... you're good at this...",
"E05ISACOS_d106": "Almost done...",
"E05ISACOS_d107": "D-[daddy_r_low]... your hands...",
"E05ISACOS_d108": "The jacket's heavy but she's so warm...",
"E05ISACOS_d109": "Stay still...",
"E05ISACOS_d110": "Why am I touching her like this...",
"E05ISACOS_d111": "The uniform... you're not really focusing on it...",
"E05ISACOS_d112": "She knows exactly what I'm doing...",
"E05ISACOS_d113": "I didn't know helping with cosplay would be like this...",
"E05ISACOS_d114": "I should stop... but I can't...",
"E05ISACOS_d115": "Now for the boots... they're crucial for Commander White.",
"E05ISACOS_d116": "Those distinctive white boots...",
"E05ISACOS_d117": "They're quite tall, like hers...",
"E05ISACOS_d118": "Help me with these? They're not easy to put on...",
"E05ISACOS_d119": "This part of the costume...",
"E05ISACOS_d120": "Sure... let's get them on.",
"E05ISACOS_d121": "They go up past my knees... just like in the game...",
"E05ISACOS_d122": "Keep it professional... it's just cosplay...",
"E05ISACOS_d123": "The buckles are tricky...",
"E05ISACOS_d124": "These do look complicated...",
"E05ISACOS_d125": "Start from the bottom... work your way up...",
"E05ISACOS_d126": "The other one needs the same... keep them even...",
"E05ISACOS_d127": "Focus on the task, not her legs...",
"E05ISACOS_d128": "Guide my hands... show me how...",
"E05ISACOS_d129": "L-like this? From ankle to thigh...",
"E05ISACOS_d130": "Her skin's so warm...",
"E05ISACOS_d131": "The buckles... they need to be tight...",
"E05ISACOS_d132": "Other side too... make them match...",
"E05ISACOS_d133": "Every touch feels dangerous...",
"E05ISACOS_d134": "They're snug... like they should be...",
"E05ISACOS_d135": "The white leather against her skin...",
"E05ISACOS_d136": "Just the skirt left... to complete her look...",
"E05ISACOS_d137": "Final piece...",
"E05ISACOS_d138": "The white skirt! Last piece...",
"E05ISACOS_d139": "Keep it professional... almost done...",
"E05ISACOS_d140": "These boots make standing difficult...",
"E05ISACOS_d141": "Help me step into it...",
"E05ISACOS_d142": "Just like a regular skirt...",
"E05ISACOS_d143": "Do I look like her? Like Commander White?",
"E05ISACOS_d144": "She's really getting into character...",
"E05ISACOS_d145": "The skirt's the final touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d146": "Let me help you into it... slowly...",
"E05ISACOS_d147": "One last chance to touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d148": "How do I look?",
"E05ISACOS_d149": "Need to check everything...",
"E05ISACOS_d150": "Inspect carefully, [daddy_r]...",
"E05ISACOS_d151": "Final inspection...",
"E05ISACOS_d152": "Fuck... that slit in the skirt... I can see everything...",
"E05ISACOS_d153": "The boots make the uniform look authentic, right?",
"E05ISACOS_d154": "Those thighs... the way her lips peek through...",
"E05ISACOS_d155": "Even with the jacket... her nipples are so visible through the lace...",
"E05ISACOS_d156": "The material's really high quality! Just like in the reference...",
"E05ISACOS_d157": "God... the way it clings to her body...",
"E05ISACOS_d158": "That innocent smile... she has no idea what she does to me...",
"E05ISACOS_d159": "Did I capture Commander White's essence, [daddy_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d160": "My beautiful little girl... when did you grow up so much...",
"E05ISACOS_d161": "Well? What do you think, [daddy_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d162": "I don't know much about Commander White, but you look stunning, Princess.",
"E05ISACOS_d163": "She's jumping into my arms...",
"E05ISACOS_d164": "You're the best, [daddy_r]! Thank you for helping!",
"E05ISACOS_d165": "Her whole body's pressed against me...",
"E05ISACOS_d166": "Isab-mmph!",
"E05ISACOS_d167": "Mmm...",
"E05ISACOS_d168": "Her lips... she's actually kissing me again...",
"E05ISACOS_d169": "Her lips... she's actually kissing me...",
"E05ISACOS_d170": "Oh god... I... I got too excited...",
"E05ISACOS_d171": "Uhm.... she's covering her face in embarrassment...",
"E05ISACOS_d172": "Isabella...",
"E05ISACOS_d173": "Maybe you should check on [gra_r] now...",
"E05ISACOS_d174": "I'll visit her later... after I finish the cosplay...",
"E05ISACOS_d175": "Of course, Princess.",
"E05ISACOS_d176": "What have I awakened in her...",

"E05ELIZIN_d001": "[mo_r]'s door is open...",
"E05ELIZIN_d002": "She never leaves it open...",
"E05ELIZIN_d003": "What's going on?",
"E05ELIZIN_d004": "Huh? She's just sitting there in her babydoll... staring at the floor...",
"E05ELIZIN_d005": "Ever since I got here, she's been like this. Lost. Empty.",
"E05ELIZIN_d006": "The light in her eyes is gone...",
"E05ELIZIN_d007": "So many bottles of pills...",
"E05ELIZIN_d008": "Different colors, different labels... scattered everywhere.",
"E05ELIZIN_d009": "[da_r]'s prescriptions... what are you doing to her?",
"E05ELIZIN_d010": "Huh?! What the-- when did she-? She's behind me...",
"E05ELIZIN_d011": "Her makeup's all smeared... has she been crying?",
"E05ELIZIN_d012": "She's just staring at herself in the mirror...",
"E05ELIZIN_d013": "[mo_r]?",
"E05ELIZIN_d014": "She's picking up more pills... swallowing them dry...",
"E05ELIZIN_d015": "Like they're candy...",
"E05ELIZIN_d016": "[mc_name]...?",
"E05ELIZIN_d017": "That smile... but those eyes are drowning in tears...",
"E05ELIZIN_d018": "When did you come in, sweetie?",
"E05ELIZIN_d019": "She's trying so hard to look okay...",
"E05ELIZIN_d020": "You should've told me you were coming to visit...",
"E05ELIZIN_d021": "Her words are slurring...",
"E05ELIZIN_d022": "Sit with me, darling... tell me about your day...",
"E05ELIZIN_d023": "[mo_r], I'm worried about you...",
"E05ELIZIN_d024": "Come here... let me hold you...",
"E05ELIZIN_d025": "Her body's so warm against mine...",
"E05ELIZIN_d026": "My sweet boy... you've grown so strong...",
"E05ELIZIN_d027": "My hands shouldn't be here... but I can't help it...",
"E05ELIZIN_d028": "Look at you... my handsome [so_r_low]...",
"E05ELIZIN_d029": "That smile... it's real this time...",
"E05ELIZIN_d030": "But something's wrong...",
"E05ELIZIN_d031": "[mo_r]... what's happening to you?",
"E05ELIZIN_d032": "Everything's perfect now... just like before...",

"E05ELIPAST_d001": "Stupid derivatives... stupid school...",
"E05ELIPAST_d002": "Damnit, what the hell is this? Why do they make math so complicated...",
"E05ELIPAST_d003": "If I don't finish this by tomorrow, I'm totally screwed for the test.",
"E05ELIPAST_d004": "Uhm... great! Now she's gonna scold me for sure!",
"E05ELIPAST_d005": "Such frustration in my precious boy...",
"E05ELIPAST_d006": "What's this? Calculus giving you trouble again?",
"E05ELIPAST_d007": "You look so adorably lost, sweetheart.",
"E05ELIPAST_d008": "[mo_r], please. I'm trying to concentrate here.",
"E05ELIPAST_d009": "Oh? Am I distracting you?",
"E05ELIPAST_d010": "I thought my brilliant [so_r_low] could handle a little... help.",
"E05ELIPAST_d011": "Just... this test tomorrow...",
"E05ELIPAST_d012": "My poor darling. Math always was your weakness.",
"E05ELIPAST_d013": "Good thing [mommy_r_low] knows just how to make it... click for you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d014": "Let [mommy_r_low] teach you...",
"E05ELIPAST_d015": "These late-night galas are so dreadfully boring. I'd much rather be here with you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d016": "Ehhh... These functions are impossible...",
"E05ELIPAST_d017": "She smells like champagne and that perfume she got from Paris.",
"E05ELIPAST_d018": "Nothing's impossible with proper... instruction.",
"E05ELIPAST_d019": "See, integration is all about finding what's hidden beneath the surface.",
"E05ELIPAST_d020": "Something I've always been rather good at, wouldn't you say?",
"E05ELIPAST_d021": "Don't react... don't react...",
"E05ELIPAST_d022": "Focus on the math, not how her breath feels against my ear.",
"E05ELIPAST_d023": "So, let's look at this integral... see how you can solve it step by step?",
"E05ELIPAST_d024": "The trick is knowing exactly when to... push forward and when to hold back.",
"E05ELIPAST_d025": "Just like in life, darling. Timing is everything.",
"E05ELIPAST_d026": "Focus, [mc_name]... just... don't think about [mo_r_low]'s... dress...",
"E05ELIPAST_d027": "God, why does she always do this after her parties?",
"E05ELIPAST_d028": "It's all about... tension...",
"E05ELIPAST_d029": "The delicate balance between variables. Between what we want and what we're allowed.",
"E05ELIPAST_d030": "Are you following me, sweetie?",
"E05ELIPAST_d031": "[mo_r], I can't focus when you're...",
"E05ELIPAST_d032": "When I'm what, darling?",
"E05ELIPAST_d033": "Using real-world applications to make your studies more... engaging?",
"E05ELIPAST_d034": "Or is it that you prefer your textbooks dry and boring?",
"E05ELIPAST_d035": "T-teaching like this...",
"E05ELIPAST_d036": "It's just... distracting.",
"E05ELIPAST_d037": "Don't think about [mommy_r_low] too much, sweetie.",
"E05ELIPAST_d038": "Eyes on your paper. Though I can't help but notice yours keep... wandering.",
"E05ELIPAST_d039": "Now, let's talk about limits...",
"E05ELIPAST_d040": "My favorite part of calculus, actually.",
"E05ELIPAST_d041": "Limits? Uh, yeah... like when something approaches but doesn't...",
"E05ELIPAST_d042": "When a function gets closer and closer to a value but never quite...",
"E05ELIPAST_d043": "She's practically sitting in my lap now. This is torture.",
"E05ELIPAST_d044": "Exactly... approaching, getting so close, just not crossing that line...",
"E05ELIPAST_d045": "The mathematics of temptation, wouldn't you say?",
"E05ELIPAST_d046": "Just like we are now... so close...",
"E05ELIPAST_d047": "I could practically solve this problem with my eyes closed. Want to see?",
"E05ELIPAST_d048": "Or would you rather just watch me, hmm?",
"E05ELIPAST_d049": "Oh God, this can't be happening...",
"E05ELIPAST_d050": "That's definitely not her perfume I'm smelling now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d051": "You know, in Milan, they taught us that mathematics is the purest form of seduction.",
"E05ELIPAST_d052": "The teasing possibility of a solution, always just out of reach.",
"E05ELIPAST_d053": "Like now, when you're so close to understanding, but something's... distracting you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d054": "I'm just trying to learn calculus, [mo_r].",
"E05ELIPAST_d055": "Can we focus on the formulas? Please?",
"E05ELIPAST_d056": "Such dedication to your studies. How... admirable.",
"E05ELIPAST_d057": "Very well, let's be proper then. No more... practical demonstrations.",
"E05ELIPAST_d058": "Maybe the distraction is the point of this lesson?",
"E05ELIPAST_d059": "You're making it hard to remember why I even cared about derivatives.",
"E05ELIPAST_d060": "Clever boy. Understanding the subtext so quickly.",
"E05ELIPAST_d061": "Perhaps you're more like your [da_full_r_low] than I thought. Always seeing... opportunities.",
"E05ELIPAST_d062": "[mo_r]! The show was amazing? I saw the news and--",
"E05ELIPAST_d063": "Oh. You're helping [mc_name] with homework? Can I watch too?",
"E05ELIPAST_d064": "Amber, darling... past your bedtime.",
"E05ELIPAST_d065": "[mommy_r]'s giving your [br_full_r_low] a very special lesson right now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d066": "But I want to hear about—",
"E05ELIPAST_d067": "I just wanted to show you what they said about your dress on TV.",
"E05ELIPAST_d068": "Bed. Now. Your [br_full_r_low] needs... tutoring.",
"E05ELIPAST_d069": "The adults are talking, sweetheart. We'll discuss your little fashion opinions tomorrow.",
"E05ELIPAST_d070": "Fine...",
"E05ELIPAST_d071": "I just thought you'd want to know they loved you...",
"E05ELIPAST_d072": "That look on Amber's face. [mo_r] crushed her without even trying.",
"E05ELIPAST_d073": "[mo_r], that was harsh. She just wanted to share something with you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d074": "Amber looked really hurt just now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d075": "Oh please, she's being dramatic. She knows I need to focus on your education.",
"E05ELIPAST_d076": "When did you become so sensitive about your [si_full_r_low]'s feelings?",
"E05ELIPAST_d077": "Should we get back to these integrals? I still don't get them.",
"E05ELIPAST_d078": "Time's running out and I really need to pass this test.",
"E05ELIPAST_d079": "That's my boy. Always focused on what matters.",
"E05ELIPAST_d080": "Where was [mommy_r], sweetie? Oh right, limits... but maybe we'll just skip those tonight.",
"E05ELIPAST_d081": "You seem tense. Perhaps we need a change of venue.",
"E05ELIPAST_d082": "Perhaps tea would help us focus...",
"E05ELIPAST_d083": "Or something stronger? I have a bottle of that cognac you pretend not to steal sips from.",
"E05ELIPAST_d084": "Our little secret, hmm? Just like these special tutoring sessions.",
"E05ELIPAST_d085": "Your [da_full_r_low] never needs to know how... hands-on [mommy_r_low]'s teaching methods are.",
"E05ELIPAST_d086": "Tea... right...",
"E05ELIPAST_d087": "How the hell am I supposed to focus on calculus now?",
"E05ELIPAST_d088": "Your [da_full_r_low]'s always at that hospital...",
"E05ELIPAST_d089": "More concerned with his precious patients than his own [fm_r_low].",
"E05ELIPAST_d090": "He wouldn't notice if we burned the house down, would he, sweetheart?",
"E05ELIPAST_d091": "He works hard, [mo_r]. That's all.",
"E05ELIPAST_d092": "Whoa—!",
"E05ELIPAST_d093": "Shit! Of course I'd trip right now!",
"E05ELIPAST_d094": "Oh my, are you alright, darling?",
"E05ELIPAST_d095": "Always so clumsy around beauty, hmm?",
"E05ELIPAST_d096": "Or perhaps you just wanted a better view?",
"E05ELIPAST_d097": "Those modeling shoots in Bali left such awkward tan lines... right?",
"E05ELIPAST_d098": "I-- I'm just... tired. Long day.",
"E05ELIPAST_d099": "Don't look up. Don't look up. Don't—I'm looking up.",
"E05ELIPAST_d100": "I should probably—",
"E05ELIPAST_d101": "It's getting late, and I still have that test...",
"E05ELIPAST_d102": "Shall we review limits again, sweetie?",
"E05ELIPAST_d103": "I find them so... fascinating. The point where restraint meets--",
"E05ELIPAST_d104": "Uhm, sure... limits, right.",
"E05ELIPAST_d105": "Why does everything she says sound like she's talking about something else?",
"E05ELIPAST_d106": "You know, we can bend them just a bit...",
"E05ELIPAST_d107": "Mathematics is all about knowing when to push beyond conventional boundaries.",
"E05ELIPAST_d108": "Can you feel the tension in the equation, darling? How everything balances on a knife's edge?",
"E05ELIPAST_d109": "She's so close I can feel her heart beating. This is wrong. This is so wrong.",
"E05ELIPAST_d110": "[mo_r]!",
"E05ELIPAST_d111": "I—you—this isn't—",
"E05ELIPAST_d112": "Move back. Now. Before this gets worse!",
"E05ELIPAST_d113": "Wait!",
"E05ELIPAST_d114": "Oh!!",
"E05ELIPAST_d115": "Quick, help [mommy_r_low] out of this... Can't let it ruin the fabric.",
"E05ELIPAST_d116": "This dress cost more than your [da_full_r_low] earns in a week.",
"E05ELIPAST_d117": "The silk is imported from Milan, and it's completely ruined now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d118": "But...",
"E05ELIPAST_d119": "She can't be serious right now. Her dress is practically see-through!",
"E05ELIPAST_d120": "Shhh... just help [mommy_r_low]...",
"E05ELIPAST_d121": "Don't act so shocked. You've seen models changing backstage plenty of times.",
"E05ELIPAST_d122": "It's just skin, darling. Beautiful, expensive skin that your [da_full_r_low] pays fortunes to maintain.",
"E05ELIPAST_d123": "Oh god, why is she... like that?",
"E05ELIPAST_d124": "This isn't normal. This isn't what [mo_full_r_low]s do.",
"E05ELIPAST_d125": "We shouldn't...",
"E05ELIPAST_d126": "Shouldn't what? Accidents happen, darling. Anyways, I can't be like this all night...",
"E05ELIPAST_d127": "Besides, it's nothing you haven't seen in those magazines you hide under your mattress.",
"E05ELIPAST_d128": "Though I must say, [mommy_r_low]'s still got it better than those cheap girls, don't you think?",
"E05ELIPAST_d129": "This is wrong...",
"E05ELIPAST_d130": "I need to get out of here, now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d131": "You should cover up, [mo_r_low]!",
"E05ELIPAST_d132": "Anyone could walk in and see you like this!",
"E05ELIPAST_d133": "Maybe you're right... let's go to the bedroom.",
"E05ELIPAST_d134": "I have something special there. Something I've been saving for the right moment.",
"E05ELIPAST_d135": "Take my hand, sweetie. Let [mommy_r_low] show you something beautiful.",
"E05ELIPAST_d136": "This is La Perla's finest. Imported from Italy, just like me.",
"E05ELIPAST_d137": "The red is called 'Promessa passionale'. Appropriate, don't you think?",
"E05ELIPAST_d138": "They only made twelve of these in the world. I wore one just like it on the Milan runway last year.",
"E05ELIPAST_d139": "Your [da_full_r_low] never notices these details...",
"E05ELIPAST_d140": "Too busy cutting into people to appreciate real art when it's right in front of him.",
"E05ELIPAST_d141": "I shouldn't be seeing this. I shouldn't be here. Why can't I move?",
"E05ELIPAST_d142": "Let me show you a new thing... just don't tell [daddy_r_low], hmm?",
"E05ELIPAST_d143": "He wouldn't understand our special bond. How alike we truly are.",
"E05ELIPAST_d144": "I see how you look at me, sweetie. It's the same way all men look at me.",
"E05ELIPAST_d145": "But you're special. You're mine. My beautiful, brilliant boy.",
"E05ELIPAST_d146": "Just a little lesson, sweetie... You can use this example on the test tomorrow...",
"E05ELIPAST_d147": "Mathematics is about relationships between bodies, isn't it? The way they attract and repel.",
"E05ELIPAST_d148": "See, the limit gets closer and closer... just like this...",
"E05ELIPAST_d149": "Feel how the tension builds as we approach the boundary?",
"E05ELIPAST_d150": "This can't be happening. My own [mo_full_r_low] is—I can't even think it.",
"E05ELIPAST_d151": "[mo_r], stop! You're drunk...",
"E05ELIPAST_d152": "This isn't you. This is the champagne talking.",
"E05ELIPAST_d153": "Please let this be the alcohol. Please don't let this be who she really is.",
"E05ELIPAST_d154": "I can't... we can't... this is insane.",
"E05ELIPAST_d155": "I'm frozen. I can't even push her away. What's wrong with me?",
"E05ELIPAST_d156": "Don't fight it, darling. Some limits are meant to be crossed.",
"E05ELIPAST_d157": "Besides, who would ever know? Our sweet little secret...",
"E05ELIPAST_d158": "Get off me! This has gone far enough!",
"E05ELIPAST_d159": "[mo_r]? I had a nightmare...",
"E05ELIPAST_d160": "I saw monsters and they were—",
"E05ELIPAST_d161": "What... what are you doing?",
"E05ELIPAST_d162": "Why are you on top of [mc_name] like that?",
"E05ELIPAST_d163": "You need help, [mo_r]. This isn't normal!",
"E05ELIPAST_d164": "How dare you reject me! After everything I've done for you!",
"E05ELIPAST_d165": "Amber! Thank god you're here. [mo_r]'s not feeling well.",
"E05ELIPAST_d166": "She had too much to drink at her party and fell. I was just helping her up.",
"E05ELIPAST_d167": "Is [mommy_r] sick? Should I get [daddy_r] from the hospital?",
"E05ELIPAST_d168": "Your face is all red, [mc_name]. Are you getting sick too?",
"E05ELIPAST_d169": "Nobody's calling anybody. Especially not your [da_full_r_low].",
"E05ELIPAST_d170": "Go back to bed!",
"E05ELIPAST_d171": "This doesn't concern you, you stupid little girl!",
"E05ELIPAST_d172": "But...",
"E05ELIPAST_d173": "You're hurting [mc_name]. I can see it in his face.",
"E05ELIPAST_d174": "Amber, please just go. You shouldn't see this.",
"E05ELIPAST_d175": "Everything's fine, [sis_r_low]. [mo_r] just needs some rest.",
"E05ELIPAST_d176": "How about I check under your bed for monsters? Would that help?",
"E05ELIPAST_d177": "Would you? The shadows were moving again and making scary shapes.",
"E05ELIPAST_d178": "You're the bravest, [mc_name]. You're not afraid of anything.",
"E05ELIPAST_d179": "If only you knew how terrified I am right now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d180": "Bed, now Amber.",
"E05ELIPAST_d181": "I won't ask again.",
"E05ELIPAST_d182": "Or I'll give you something to have nightmares about.",
"E05ELIPAST_d183": "The look in [mo_r]'s eyes... I've never seen her like this. It's like she's possessed.",
"E05ELIPAST_d184": "Okay... I'm sorry...",
"E05ELIPAST_d185": "Let's go check your room right now, okay? I'll stay until you fall asleep.",
"E05ELIPAST_d186": "I'll even tell you that story about the brave fox you like so much.",
"E05ELIPAST_d187": "The one where she outsmarts the snake? That's my favorite!",
"E05ELIPAST_d188": "Can we use flashlights under the blanket like a tent again?",
"E05ELIPAST_d189": "Anything to get away from this nightmare.",
"E05ELIPAST_d190": "I-- I better just go... study alone...",
"E05ELIPAST_d191": "This... whatever this is... it needs to stop. Please.",
"E05ELIPAST_d192": "Go, study... alone.",
"E05ELIPAST_d193": "Ungrateful boy. Just like your [da_full_r_low].",
"E05ELIPAST_d194": "I've never been so relieved to escape a room in my life.",
"E05ELIPAST_d195": "I'm sorry, [mo_r]. This was... I don't even know what this was.",
"E05ELIPAST_d196": "But it can never happen again. Never.",
"E05ELIPAST_d197": "Don't you dare judge me. You wanted it too. I saw it in your eyes.",
"E05ELIPAST_d198": "Go play hero for your [si_full_r_low]. It's what you do best, isn't it?",
"E05ELIPAST_d199": "I need to protect Amber from... whatever [mo_r] is becoming.",
"E05ELIPAST_d200": "Tonight...I didn't want to be a [mo_r], I just wanted to be Elizabeth.",
"E05ELIPAST_d201": "The Elizabeth who commands runways. The one men fight over backstage.",
"E05ELIPAST_d202": "Not this shadow of myself, trapped between [chi_r] who needs me and a husband who doesn't see me.",
"E05ELIPAST_d203": "Is it so wrong to want to feel that power again? Before it all slips away?",
"E05ELIPAST_d204": "They never understand what I sacrifice for them.",
"E05ELIPAST_d205": "My career is at its peak, and what does Michael do? Works all night.",
"E05ELIPAST_d206": "Men like the idea of a beautiful wife until she demands the attention she deserves.",
"E05ELIPAST_d207": "Then they hide behind their work, their ethics... or run to younger women.",

"E05ELISHOW_d001": "Where's she? ... Bathroom?",
"E05ELISHOW_d002": "One minute we were talking, the next she just... disappeared.",
"E05ELISHOW_d003": "These memory flashes are coming back. Why? I can't tell what's now and what's then anymore.",
"E05ELISHOW_d004": "The shower?",
"E05ELISHOW_d005": "I don't think she's in any state to take a shower. She'll just flood the room.",
"E05ELISHOW_d006": "With all those pills in her system, she could slip, hit her head...",
"E05ELISHOW_d007": "The last thing I need is to find her passed out in a puddle of water.",
"E05ELISHOW_d008": "Damn, when did I become the parent in this relationship?",
"E05ELISHOW_d009": "Maybe I should check on her. Make sure she's okay.",
"E05ELISHOW_d010": "[mo_r]? You there?",
"E05ELISHOW_d011": "I just want to make sure you're alright.",
"E05ELISHOW_d012": "This feels oddly familiar.",
"E05ELISHOW_d013": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}I was searching for the ocean beyond your shoulder...",
"E05ELISHOW_d014": "What's she doing?",
"E05ELISHOW_d015": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}In the corner of a landscape blurring with tears...",
"E05ELISHOW_d016": "Singing?",
"E05ELISHOW_d017": "That old Akina Nakamori song she used to sing when I was a kid.",
"E05ELISHOW_d018": "She's completely out of it. Those pills mixed with whatever she drank...",
"E05ELISHOW_d019": "I should get her out of there before she hurts herself.",
"E05ELISHOW_d020": "Is this another manipulation? Another way to pull me into her web?",
"E05ELISHOW_d021": "Thirty years of modeling taught her how to make anything look natural.",
"E05ELISHOW_d022": "Fuck... even at her age, her body's still incredible.",
"E05ELISHOW_d023": "Those long legs, that ass that's still firm despite the years...",
"E05ELISHOW_d024": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor} That shore scattered with our memories...",
"E05ELISHOW_d025": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}I want to turn it into a small green stone and keep it in my heart...",
"E05ELISHOW_d026": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}Between repeating dawns and dusks...",
"E05ELISHOW_d027": "I've got a bad feeling...",
"E05ELISHOW_d028": "She's not even aware I'm here.",
"E05ELISHOW_d029": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}We depart from the season of goodbyes...",
"E05ELISHOW_d030": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}Leaving a fragment of emerald in each other's hearts...",
"E05ELISHOW_d031": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}If you close your eyes, kiss my eyelids...",

"E05ELISHOW_d037": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}Because I hold a fragment of emerald against my heart...",
"E05ELISHOW_d038": "I should have never left Milan... never married a man who can't see beauty decay...",
"E05ELISHOW_d039": "Thirty years of my life... wasted...",
"E05ELISHOW_d040": "My body betrays me... inside and out...",
"E05ELISHOW_d041": "I've never seen her this vulnerable before.",
"E05ELISHOW_d042": "She's always been obsessed with her image, even at home. This is... disturbing.",
"E05ELISHOW_d043": "No wonder she takes so many pills. Reality must be unbearable for her.",
"E05ELISHOW_d044": "Sweetie... how long have... have you been watching?",
"E05ELISHOW_d045": "Your [mo_full_r_low] is a mess, isn't she? Not the woman you remember.",
"E05ELISHOW_d046": "You shouldn't see [mo_r] like this, so pathetic... so old...",
"E05ELISHOW_d047": "God, these sagging breasts, these stretch marks... this wasted body.",
"E05ELISHOW_d048": "[mo_r], no. You're beautiful. Always have been. You're just not well.",
"E05ELISHOW_d049": "The pills, the drinking—they're making everything worse.",
"E05ELISHOW_d050": "Let me help you. Please.",
"E05ELISHOW_d051": "I don't deserve a [so_r_low] like you. So... so good to me. And what am... what do... what have...",
"E05ELISHOW_d052": "Why am... am I such a failure? A drunk... a junkie...",
"E05ELISHOW_d053": "Let me help you get to bed.",
"E05ELISHOW_d054": "You're going to catch cold standing there like this.",
"E05ELISHOW_d055": "Remember when you'd help me prepare for tests? How patient you were?",
"E05ELISHOW_d056": "You'd stay up all night if that's what it took. No matter how tired you were.",
"E05ELISHOW_d057": "That woman is still in there somewhere. The one who cared so much.",
"E05ELISHOW_d058": "Life hasn't been easy for either of us, has it?",
"E05ELISHOW_d059": "But we're still here. We're still standing. That has to count for something.",
"E05ELISHOW_d060": "Let's just get you to bed before you catch cold.",
"E05ELISHOW_d061": "Remember how you used to come to my room in that silk nightgown?",
"E05ELISHOW_d062": "The way it clung to your body... how you'd let it slip off your shoulder...",
"E05ELISHOW_d063": "How your hand would always find its way under the covers...",
"E05ELISHOW_d064": "Remember when you'd help me prepare for shoots?",
"E05ELISHOW_d065": "You had such an eye for what worked. Which outfits would photograph best.",
"E05ELISHOW_d066": "You knew my body better than anyone... every angle, every curve...",
"E05ELISHOW_d067": "Of course, [mo_r]. We made a great team, didn't we?",
"E05ELISHOW_d068": "You always looked perfect. Every magazine cover, every runway.",
"E05ELISHOW_d069": "Yes, yes. You were so helpful... and... and kind.",
"E05ELISHOW_d070": "Even when the other boys your age were out playing, you stayed with [mommy_r_low].",
"E05ELISHOW_d071": "My perfect little man. The only one who ever truly saw me.",
"E05ELISHOW_d072": "I'm tired...",
"E05ELISHOW_d073": "...of pretending everything is okay. It isn't... it hasn't been...",

"E05ELISHOW_d075": "My beauty, my sanity, my purpose... what am I without them?",
"E05ELISHOW_d076": "Please... just hold me...",
"E05ELISHOW_d077": "Make me feel beautiful again. Like when you were younger and looked at me that way.",
"E05ELISHOW_d078": "...please...",
"E05ELISHOW_d079": "Just for tonight. Just for now. Before I disappear completely.",
"E05ELISHOW_d080": "I need to feel something... anything besides... this...",
"E05ELISHOW_d081": "Feel like a woman again... not just a decoration in this house...",
"E05ELISHOW_d082": "Your touch... always made me feel so alive... so wanted...",
"E05ELISHOW_d083": "Look at us...",
"E05ELISHOW_d084": "Do anyone still want me? Even like this? Even with these wrinkles, these sagging breasts?",
"E05ELISHOW_d085": "I'm... disgusting... an old woman... a monster...",
"E05ELISHOW_d086": "Your hands feel so good... so different from him...",
"E05ELISHOW_d087": "No one has to know... our little secret... like before... right?",
"E05ELISHOW_d088": "I need to feel something... anything besides... this...",
"E05ELISHOW_d089": "Some mornings I wake up and don't recognize myself in the mirror.",
"E05ELISHOW_d090": "Where did she go? That woman everyone wanted? That woman you adored?",
"E05ELISHOW_d091": "Look at us...",
"E05ELISHOW_d092": "Time is so cruel, isn't it? Especially to women like me.",
"E05ELISHOW_d093": "I'm... disgusting... an old woman... a monster...",
"E05ELISHOW_d094": "I turned down Paris for this life. My last chance at the big time.",
"E05ELISHOW_d095": "Now I'm just Michael's aging wife. The European Rose, wilted.",
"E05ELISHOW_d096": "[mo_r], look at me.",
"E05ELISHOW_d097": "You need to stop this. You're hurting yourself.",
"E05ELISHOW_d098": "You are the most beautiful woman in the world. No mirror will tell otherwise.",
"E05ELISHOW_d099": "Let me help you get dressed and back to bed.",
"E05ELISHOW_d100": "No... get out! GET OUT!",
"E05ELISHOW_d101": "Don't look at me like that! With pity! I don't need your fucking pity!",
"E05ELISHOW_d102": "You're just like him! Pretending to care while judging every flaw!",
"E05ELISHOW_d103": "GET OUT! NOW! LEAVE ME ALONE!",
"E05ELISHOW_d104": "Fuck. I handled that all wrong.",
"E05ELISHOW_d105": "She's too far gone right now. Too many pills, too much alcohol, too much self-loathing.",
"E05ELISHOW_d106": "I'll check on her when she sobers up. If she even remembers any of this.",

"E05PZSMS_d001": "Elizabeth's breakdown was worse than I expected. She needs professional help, not more pills.",
"E05PZSMS_d002": "I need to clear my head. Focus on something I can actually solve.",
"E05PZSMS_d003": "That attack on Paz in my apartment... I should check how she's doing.",
"E05PZSMS_d004": "At least with Paz, I know where I stand. Unlike this twisted [fm_r_low] dynamic.",
"E05PZSMS_d005": "I'm just gonna make sure everything is all right.",
"E05PZSMS_d006": "She took a beating because of me. Because she was looking into things I asked her to.",
"E05PZSMS_d007": "While I've been dealing with Elizabeth's drama, Paz has been putting herself in real danger.",
"E05PZSMS_d008": "What if that masked woman comes back for her? What if she's hurt worse than she let on?",
"E05PZSMS_d009": "I couldn't protect Elizabeth from herself. Maybe I can at least help Paz.",
"E05PZSMS_d010": "After everything we've been through in Osaka, I owe her that much.",

"E05PZSMSS_d001": "Hey... u ok after that attack?",
"E05PZSMSS_d002": "Hey, yea I'm fine. Nothing serious {outlinecolor=#ffffff00}👍{/outlinecolor}",

"E05PZVC_d002": "Thought I'd never cave, but turns out flip phones aren't cutting it anymore.",
"E05PZVC_d003": "Don't judge the mess. Been busy with this... situation.",
"E05PZVC_d004": "So, about those pictures from my apartment—did you manage to recover them?",
"E05PZVC_d005": "Damn, she doesn't even realize how she's sitting. Same old Paz, zero self-awareness.",
"E05PZVC_d006": "Yes. One moment...",
"E05PZVC_d007": "Gotta find it in this disaster of a gallery... there.",
"E05PZVC_d008": "Check this out.",
"E05PZVC_d009": "{a=show:picview_ep05_sms03}{image=thumb_ep05_sms03}",
"E05PZVC_d010": "That's some occult shit, isn't it?",
"E05PZVC_d011": "Freaky as hell. Found it exactly like this when I got there.",
"E05PZVC_d012": "Does it mean anything to you? I mean that's what that woman said, that everything was for you.",
"E05PZVC_d013": "Fox-mask lady had your name, knew your apartment. Creepy stuff.",
"E05PZVC_d014": "Not your typical break-in, that's for sure.",
"E05PZVC_d015": "I don't know, I'm gonna check what I can find about it.",
"E05PZVC_d016": "What the hell have I gotten her into?",
"E05PZVC_d017": "Do you think it's related to the Tanaka case?",
"E05PZVC_d018": "The Kobe Yagamaguchi-gumi?",
"E05PZVC_d019": "Maybe... I mean the case got closed pretty abruptly... like they didn't want us to keep investigating it.",
"E05PZVC_d020": "Just when we were getting somewhere, poof—gone.",
"E05PZVC_d021": "You get promoted even when you were so deep in that case and suddenly all the evidence goes away.",
"E05PZVC_d022": "Convenient timing, don't you think? You're out, case closed, everyone moves on.",
"E05PZVC_d023": "Except now we've got fox-mask lady leaving you presents.",
"E05PZVC_d024": "Well I can't argue about that...",
"E05PZVC_d025": "She's pissed. That spark in her eyes is the same one from the Takahashi raid. Nothing good follows that look.",
"E05PZVC_d026": "I know I'm not like you. You're like a genius and all, but don't you find that suspicious?",
"E05PZVC_d027": "You of all people. The guy who sees patterns in everything.",
"E05PZVC_d028": "Ever since you left, stuff's been weird at the precinct.",
"E05PZVC_d029": "I don't know... what are you trying to say, Paz?",
"E05PZVC_d030": "That someone's covering tracks?",
"E05PZVC_d031": "I've been checking all these stuff...",
"E05PZVC_d032": "Been digging through what's left of your case files. Most of it's gone or redacted.",
"E05PZVC_d033": "Sorry for unprofessional look but I've been here since 5 AM.",
"E05PZVC_d034": "Haven't exactly been prioritizing dress code lately.",
"E05PZVC_d035": "So, there's no trace left in the system. Like someone deleted them.",
"E05PZVC_d036": "Pictures, reports, witness statements—poof. Digital trail's cold.",
"E05PZVC_d037": "Someone's got access who shouldn't.",
"E05PZVC_d038": "Are you suggesting a conspiracy or we have a mole or something?",
"E05PZVC_d039": "Maybe. Don't you think it's all a bit... convenient? Like, too perfect?",
"E05PZVC_d040": "Our rookies couldn't delete lunch orders without leaving traces.",
"E05PZVC_d041": "So, let me guess, what do you propose to do, then?",
"E05PZVC_d042": "She's already made up her mind. That determined look hasn't changed since academy days.",
"E05PZVC_d043": "We can investigate together. On our own.",
"E05PZVC_d044": "Like we did with the smuggling ring. Just you and me, off the books.",
"E05PZVC_d045": "Before things went to shit.",
"E05PZVC_d046": "Paz, I wish I could help, but honestly, what can we do right now?",
"E05PZVC_d047": "I'm still injured and fucked up in Tokyo and you're still a field officer in Osaka, right?",
"E05PZVC_d048": "Can't exactly hop on a train with this leg.",
"E05PZVC_d049": "So you say I can't investigate because I'm not a detective like you?",
"E05PZVC_d050": "After all the crap we went through? That's how it is now?",
"E05PZVC_d051": "Rank finally went to your head, [mc_name]?",
"E05PZVC_d052": "It's not about that. I didn't even want a promotion in the first place.",
"E05PZVC_d053": "But the fact remains that you can't access some stuff.",
"E05PZVC_d054": "Also, how could we do that from 500 kilometers away? You know that's not going to work, right?",
"E05PZVC_d055": "This isn't about badges or rank.",
"E05PZVC_d056": "Besides that, what if something like the incident from that night happens to you again? What will happen then?",
"E05PZVC_d057": "I'm not there to have your back this time.",
"E05PZVC_d058": "Well, we could start with the info we got from the apartment, like that picture. It's a start, right?",
"E05PZVC_d059": "I'm already in it. Fox-mask lady made sure of that.",
"E05PZVC_d060": "And don't worry about me. If anything like that ever happened to me again, well... let's say that I would make sure to be prepared this time.",
"E05PZVC_d061": "Got my piece under the pillow now. Won't catch me sleeping again.",
"E05PZVC_d062": "You should rest, you still on night shift?",
"E05PZVC_d063": "She hasn't changed a bit. Still charging ahead, consequences be damned.",
"E05PZVC_d064": "Can't sleep lately. Remember our late shifts? When you'd bring coffee at 3 AM?",
"E05PZVC_d065": "That god-awful vending machine sludge you called coffee.",
"E05PZVC_d066": "Kinda miss it, actually. Quiet nights, bad coffee, good company.",
"E05PZVC_d067": "Worst coffee in Osaka, yeah. But your company made it taste good.",
"E05PZVC_d068": "Never did find coffee that bad in Tokyo. It's a special Osaka talent.",
"E05PZVC_d069": "Miss that. Miss working with you.",
"E05PZVC_d070": "Place isn't the same without your brooding ass around.",
"E05PZVC_d071": "Oh! Almost forgot.",
"E05PZVC_d072": "Check this too",
"E05PZVC_d073": "{a=show:picview_ep05_sms04}{image=thumb_ep05_sms04}",
"E05PZVC_d074": "Found it around all those bells.",
"E05PZVC_d075": "Looks familiar?",
"E05PZVC_d076": "A key?",
"E05PZVC_d077": "That key... reminds me of something, but I can't place it.",
"E05PZVC_d078": "That's the key of the ritual circle found on your apartment.",
"E05PZVC_d079": "Center of the whole thing. Like it was some kind of focal point.",
"E05PZVC_d080": "Do you have it?",
"E05PZVC_d081": "I need to get a closer look at it.",
"E05PZVC_d082": "Sadly I don't. It's in evidence storage at the PD.",
"E05PZVC_d083": "Standard procedure. Logged and bagged.",
"E05PZVC_d084": "Evidence locker 3, if you're curious.",
"E05PZVC_d085": "Do you think I should take a trip there and retrieve it, what you say?",
"E05PZVC_d086": "Wouldn't be hard. Night shift's usually just Takeda, and he sleeps half the time.",
"E05PZVC_d087": "In and out, ten minutes tops.",
"E05PZVC_d088": "What? Stealing from an Osaka PD evidence locker?",
"E05PZVC_d089": "You can't be serious... that's career suicide!",
"E05PZVC_d090": "They catch you, that's it. No second chances.",
"E05PZVC_d091": "Well... you already have seen what happens to anything that has a link with the Kobe Yagamaguchi-gumi, haven't you?",
"E05PZVC_d092": "How long before this key disappears too? A day? A week?",
"E05PZVC_d093": "You know I'm right. We're running out of time.",
"E05PZVC_d094": "I don't know... I can't push you to do that...",
"E05PZVC_d095": "It's your career on the line, not mine.",
"E05PZVC_d096": "Don't talk about pushing, lol, I haven't forgotten you pushed me from the car that night",
"E05PZVC_d097": "Saved my ass then. Maybe it's my turn to return the favor.",
"E05PZVC_d098": "Well, it's up to you. I'm already deep in this.",
"E05PZVC_d099": "Say the word, partner. Just like old times.",
"E05PZVC_d100": "You really don't have to do it.",
"E05PZVC_d101": "But... yeah. Go for it. And be careful. Please. No risks.",
"E05PZVC_d102": "First sign of trouble, you bail. Promise me that.",
"E05PZVC_d103": "No, Paz. We do this by the book. Request the evidence properly.",
"E05PZVC_d104": "I'm not letting you throw away your badge for this.",
"E05PZVC_d105": "We'll find another way. We always do.",
"E05PZVC_d106": "Yes, sir!",
"E05PZVC_d107": "Look at you, all worried. It's cute.",
"E05PZVC_d108": "Let me know when it's safe for you to head over.",
"E05PZVC_d109": "I'm going right now!",
"E05PZVC_d110": "By the book? Seriously? After everything we've seen?",
"E05PZVC_d111": "You know that key won't be there in 24 hours.",
"E05PZVC_d112": "But fine. Your call, [mc_name]. Hope you know what you're doing.",
"E05PZVC_d113": "Wait, NOW? Like, literally? Are you crazy?!",
"E05PZVC_d114": "God, Paz, at least wait till morning!",
"E05PZVC_d115": "You don't become a detective by being careful all the time, do you, [mc_name]?",
"E05PZVC_d116": "Night's the perfect time. Fewer eyes.",
"E05PZVC_d117": "I know you're frustrated. I am too. But we can't stoop to their level.",
"E05PZVC_d118": "If we break the rules, we're no better than them.",
"E05PZVC_d119": "Rules. Right. Because they've worked so well for us.",
"E05PZVC_d120": "Wake up, [mc_name]. The game is rigged.",
"E05PZVC_d121": "I don't like the idea, but okay...",
"E05PZVC_d122": "Just let me know when it's over, and stay safe, okay?",
"E05PZVC_d123": "And Paz? Thanks. I mean it.",
"E05PZVC_d124": "Just give me time to figure something out from this end.",
"E05PZVC_d125": "We'll get that key, but the right way.",
"E05PZVC_d126": "Time. The one thing we don't have. But whatever.",
"E05PZVC_d127": "Don't worry, [mc_name]. You can always count on me.",
"E05PZVC_d128": "Like old times, right? Me doing the legwork, you overthinking everything.",
"E05PZVC_d129": "See ya later.",
"E05PZVC_d130": "See ya, Paz. Be careful out there.",
"E05PZVC_d131": "Twenty-four hours. That's all you get.",
"E05PZVC_d132": "After that, I'm doing it my way, partner or not.",
"E05PZVC_d133": "Don't let me down, [mc_name].",
"E05PZVC_d134": "I won't. I promise.",

"E05NMBATH_d001": "That call with Paz has my head spinning. Rituals, fox masks, evidence theft...",
"E05NMBATH_d002": "I need to clear my mind.",
"E05NMBATH_d003": "After what I saw by the pool this morning, I should check on Nanami... just in case!",
"E05NMBATH_d004": "Searching for something, [da_full_r]?",
"E05NMBATH_d005": "Or should I say... someone? You look like you're on a mission.",
"E05NMBATH_d006": "Madison and Nanami. Seen them?",
"E05NMBATH_d007": "They were supposed to be doing yoga or something.",
"E05NMBATH_d008": "Your real [dau_r_low] is right here.",
"E05NMBATH_d009": "Yes, yes, Commander White, don't be jealous now.",
"E05NMBATH_d010": "I just want to make sure Nanami is okay. Madison can be... intense.",
"E05NMBATH_d011": "They're not in this bathroom.",
"E05NMBATH_d012": "Wait! I know where they are... follow me.",
"E05NMBATH_d013": "Madison has a special spot for her 'private lessons' with Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d014": "I've seen them disappear there before. Madison thinks she's so sneaky.",
"E05NMBATH_d015": "Ok.",
"E05NMBATH_d016": "Lead the way, Commander.",
"E05NMBATH_d017": "Now we just need to head left this way, and we'll find a new spot you haven't seen yet.",
"E05NMBATH_d018": "What the fuck?! Another room?",
"E05NMBATH_d019": "How many secret spaces does this house have?",
"E05NMBATH_d020": "Just when I think I know this place, something new appears.",
"E05NMBATH_d021": "They probably went to take a bath together... like they do most times...",
"E05NMBATH_d022": "Madison says it's 'traditional Japanese bonding' or whatever.",
"E05NMBATH_d023": "She's been doing it since they became friends.",
"E05NMBATH_d024": "Most times?!!",
"E05NMBATH_d025": "And nobody thought this was weird?",
"E05NMBATH_d026": "Yeah... like.. every time that Nanami is around...",
"E05NMBATH_d027": "Madison's very... protective of their friendship.",
"E05NMBATH_d028": "Gets super jealous if anyone else spends time with Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d029": "Wow...",
"E05NMBATH_d030": "That explains a lot about how she reacted when I talked to Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d031": "What exactly is Madison doing here?",
"E05NMBATH_d032": "Anyway, I'm off to the cosplay contest! I don't know why you wanted to check on them, but here it is, just in case.",
"E05NMBATH_d033": "Be careful though. Madison will flip if she catches you spying.",
"E05NMBATH_d034": "Just don't say or think anything that might upset me...",
"E05NMBATH_d035": "You know how I feel about you paying attention to other girls.",
"E05NMBATH_d036": "Yes, ma'am, Commander White, ma'am.",
"E05NMBATH_d037": "Go win that contest. Show them what a real cosplayer looks like.",
"E05NMBATH_d038": "Don't mock me, [da_r_low]!",
"E05NMBATH_d039": "I worked hard on this costume. I'm going to crush the competition.",
"E05NMBATH_d040": "Unlike some people, I actually finish what I start.",
"E05NMBATH_d041": "The garden greenhouse... converted to a Japanese bath? Elizabeth's extravagance knows no bounds.",
"E05NMBATH_d042": "Beautiful place though. Almost peaceful, if it weren't for what's happening in there.",
"E05NMBATH_d043": "I can hear voices... That's definitely Nanami and Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d044": "What are you looking at?",
"E05NMBATH_d045": "Spying again, [br_full_r_low]? Becoming quite the habit.",
"E05NMBATH_d046": "First by the pool, now here. Developing a taste for voyeurism?",
"E05NMBATH_d047": "Just passing by. Didn't know anyone was here.",
"E05NMBATH_d048": "Thought you'd left.",
"E05NMBATH_d049": "Yeah, but.. uhm.. just checking up on things.",
"E05NMBATH_d050": "Making sure everything's okay after this morning.",
"E05NMBATH_d051": "Of course you are.",
"E05NMBATH_d052": "Always so concerned. Such a protective big [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d053": "Though I notice you're more protective of some than others.",
"E05NMBATH_d054": "Woah... Almost caught me checking on them!",
"E05NMBATH_d055": "Madison's eyes... that wasn't just annoyance. That was pure possessive rage.",
"E05NMBATH_d056": "Maybe I should back off. But something about this feels wrong.",
"E05NMBATH_d057": "Is she going to get back? Maybe she is going to change clothes or something...",
"E05NMBATH_d058": "I mean, Nanami is alone now... I can ask her how she's doing...",
"E05NMBATH_d059": "But if Madison catches me talking to her again...",
"E05NMBATH_d060": "Just need to check if she's okay...",
"E05NMBATH_d061": "If Madison's doing something to her... I can't just stand by.",
"E05NMBATH_d062": "And if Nanami's uncomfortable, she might not know how to speak up.",
"E05NMBATH_d063": "Really, [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05NMBATH_d064": "Another man thinking he has the right to invade a woman's space.",
"E05NMBATH_d065": "Did [daddy_r_low] teach you to be a peeping tom, or is that natural male instinct?",
"E05NMBATH_d066": "I was just—",
"E05NMBATH_d067": "Making sure Nanami isn't being manipulated.",
"E05NMBATH_d068": "Manipulated? Please.",
"E05NMBATH_d069": "You're exactly like [da_full_r]. Pretending nobility while satisfying your disgusting urges.",
"E05NMBATH_d070": "Men never protect women. They just pick which predator gets first access.",
"E05NMBATH_d071": "That's why I protect her from men like you--",
"E05NMBATH_d072": "From men, period. The world's greatest disease.",
"E05NMBATH_d073": "Don't make me tell her what you tried to do.",
"E05NMBATH_d074": "I'd hate to shatter her pure image of her precious [mc_name].",
"E05NMBATH_d075": "Though maybe seeing your true nature would be the best lesson...",
"E05NMBATH_d076": "Maybe I should just go...",
"E05NMBATH_d077": "Madison's hatred runs deeper than I thought. Has she always seen me this way?",
"E05NMBATH_d078": "Maddie! Y-you're back!",
"E05NMBATH_d079": "Sorry for the interruption, sweet one. Just chasing off a pest.",
"E05NMBATH_d080": "Was someone there? I thought I heard voices...",
"E05NMBATH_d081": "Nobody important. Just my disgusting [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d082": "[mc_name]? But he's not—",
"E05NMBATH_d083": "Let me tell you what men really think about girls like us, Nanami...",
"E05NMBATH_d084": "Still lurking around, [br_full_r_low]? Can't find anything better to do?",
"E05NMBATH_d085": "Just making sure everyone's alright.",
"E05NMBATH_d086": "How noble. Always the [fm_r_low] protector.",
"E05NMBATH_d087": "She's gone back inside. What now?",
"E05NMBATH_d088": "Nanami's alone with her again.",
"E05NMBATH_d089": "Something about their 'friendship' doesn't sit right.",
"E05NMBATH_d090": "I'll just observe from here. Need to see what Madison's really up to.",
"E05NMBATH_d091": "Here, I brought some water from inside.",
"E05NMBATH_d092": "Thank you, Maddie.",
"E05NMBATH_d093": "Of course, sweetie. I always take care of what's mine.",
"E05NMBATH_d094": "Ehm, Maddie. I am thirsty too...",
"E05NMBATH_d095": "Could I have some?",
"E05NMBATH_d096": "I know a special way we can share.",
"E05NMBATH_d097": "Mmph!!",
"E05NMBATH_d098": "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!!",
"E05NMBATH_d099": "Did she just—? With Nanami?",
"E05NMBATH_d100": "So? Did you like that?",
"E05NMBATH_d101": "First time sharing like girls do? Like women do?",
"E05NMBATH_d102": "I-- I didn't expect that at all...",
"E05NMBATH_d103": "You're just too cute, Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d104": "Thank you, Maddie...",
"E05NMBATH_d105": "But wasn't that a kiss?",
"E05NMBATH_d106": "No... That was just sharing water.",
"E05NMBATH_d107": "Don't overthink it.",
"E05NMBATH_d108": "Eh?",
"E05NMBATH_d109": "But your lips...",
"E05NMBATH_d110": "Kissing is more like this.",
"E05NMBATH_d111": "Let me show you what real women do together.",
"E05NMBATH_d112": "What we can share that men can never understand.",
"E05NMBATH_d113": "Fuck! She's completely manipulating her.",
"E05NMBATH_d114": "Using Nanami's insecurity and need for acceptance.",
"E05NMBATH_d115": "Feel the difference?",
"E05NMBATH_d116": "How it makes your heart race?",
"E05NMBATH_d117": "Yeah... but...",
"E05NMBATH_d118": "Isn't this wrong? We're both girls...",
"E05NMBATH_d119": "I don't mind teaching you more, just if you want to.",
"E05NMBATH_d120": "Men made those rules to control us.",
"E05NMBATH_d121": "It's not like we are girlfriends or anything like that.",
"E05NMBATH_d122": "We are just friends that teach things to each other...",
"E05NMBATH_d123": "Special, pure friends. Without men's corruption.",
"E05NMBATH_d124": "Ehm... I just think we shouldn't do that kind of thing...",
"E05NMBATH_d125": "My [mo_full_r_low] would be upset...",
"E05NMBATH_d126": "Oh? Why not?",
"E05NMBATH_d127": "Do you think I'm disgusting now?",
"E05NMBATH_d128": "Am I the only one who wants to be special friends?",
"E05NMBATH_d129": "Everyone always leaves me. Even you now...",
"E05NMBATH_d130": "Maybe I should just disappear...",
"E05NMBATH_d131": "No! Please don't cry!",
"E05NMBATH_d132": "Don't say things like that, Maddie!",
"E05NMBATH_d133": "You hate me now...",
"E05NMBATH_d134": "Everyone does. I'm too broken to love.",
"E05NMBATH_d135": "Never! You're my best friend!",
"E05NMBATH_d136": "I could never hate you! Never!",
"E05NMBATH_d137": "Do you really mean it?",
"E05NMBATH_d138": "You won't abandon me like everyone else?",
"E05NMBATH_d139": "Yeah!",
"E05NMBATH_d140": "You saved me when I was alone. I'd never leave you.",
"E05NMBATH_d141": "Then let's have lots of fun!",
"E05NMBATH_d142": "I'm so happy.",
"E05NMBATH_d143": "Just us girls. No men to ruin our purity.",
"E05NMBATH_d144": "Me too.",
"E05NMBATH_d145": "As long as we're just friends...",
"E05NMBATH_d146": "So this is what Isabella meant about Madison and Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d147": "Amber warned me about this side of Madison. Should've listened.",
"E05NMBATH_d148": "They have no idea I'm watching. I should go, but...",
"E05NMBATH_d149": "What Madison's doing doesn't seem right. Nanami looks uncomfortable.",
"E05NMBATH_d150": "Relax, Nanami-chan. Your muscles are so tense.",
"E05NMBATH_d151": "A proper bath is about more than just getting clean.",
"E05NMBATH_d152": "M-Maddie... this feels different from last time...",
"E05NMBATH_d153": "What happend? Don't you wanna take a bath together? Are we not friends anymore?",
"E05NMBATH_d154": "After everything I've done for you? All those times I protected you?",
"E05NMBATH_d155": "Ah! No, it's not that!",
"E05NMBATH_d156": "I'm just embarrassed, that's all!",
"E05NMBATH_d157": "It's just... your hands are...",
"E05NMBATH_d158": "Wow, Nanami. Your body is really beautiful!",
"E05NMBATH_d159": "So soft, so pure.",
"E05NMBATH_d160": "You don't need to be shy around me. We are just girls bathing together...",
"E05NMBATH_d161": "I-I know, but my [mo_full_r_low] always said touching like this is...",
"E05NMBATH_d162": "Now, let's continue having fun!",
"E05NMBATH_d163": "Your [mo_full_r_low]'s ideas are so old-fashioned. This is how modern girls bond.",
"E05NMBATH_d164": "Eh... That tickles a little bit... aah...",
"E05NMBATH_d165": "Should we be doing this, Maddie?",
"E05NMBATH_d166": "Let's wash this area next, okay?",
"E05NMBATH_d167": "Every part needs proper attention, Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d168": "That... That's... My...",
"E05NMBATH_d169": "Maddie, I don't think we should—",
"E05NMBATH_d170": "Hmm? What's wrong? Is this place dirty too?",
"E05NMBATH_d171": "Don't worry, I know exactly how to clean it properly.",
"E05NMBATH_d172": "Trust me, Nanami. I'd never hurt you like a man would.",
"E05NMBATH_d173": "Aaah... Nnngg... Mmm...",
"E05NMBATH_d174": "This isn't—I've never—",
"E05NMBATH_d175": "Your face is so cute when you're like this.",
"E05NMBATH_d176": "Ehh... Aah...",
"E05NMBATH_d177": "See how special our friendship is? This is what I was talking about.",
"E05NMBATH_d178": "I can't... I'm feeling...",
"E05NMBATH_d179": "Men could never understand this connection.",
"E05NMBATH_d180": "Aaaaah!!",
"E05NMBATH_d181": "See? It wasn't bad at all, don't ya think?",
"E05NMBATH_d182": "Friends help friends get clean...",
"E05NMBATH_d183": "And now you're truly clean, inside and out.",
"E05NMBATH_d184": "Maddie... I feel strange...",
"E05NMBATH_d185": "Shhh... It's okay.",
"E05NMBATH_d186": "She's looking this way. Did she spot me?",
"E05NMBATH_d187": "Nanami looks completely out of it. What has Madison done to her?",
"E05NMBATH_d188": "That smile... she's proud of herself. Of breaking Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d189": "I just have to grab more soap from over there. You wait here, ok?",
"E05NMBATH_d190": "Rest a little, Nanami. The first time is always intense.",
"E05NMBATH_d191": "First... time?",
"E05NMBATH_d192": "Shit!",
"E05NMBATH_d193": "She's coming this way. I need to move...",
"E05NMBATH_d194": "Enjoying the view, [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05NMBATH_d195": "Pathetic male voyeur.",
"E05NMBATH_d196": "Shit!",
"E05NMBATH_d197": "What you're doing to her is wrong, Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d198": "Whatever, it doesn't matter anyway.",
"E05NMBATH_d199": "She's mine. Only mine.",
"E05NMBATH_d200": "A lesson for you, dear [br_full_r_low] - while men watch, women act.",
"E05NMBATH_d201": "Now go take care of your... problem. Somewhere else.",
"E05NMBATH_d202": "Nanami needs help, but confronting Madison now would only make things worse.",
"E05NMBATH_d203": "Before I tell Nanami exactly what kind of pervert you really are.",
"E05NMBATH_d204": "Whatever... Alright, bye.",
"E05NMBATH_d205": "I need to see what happens next between them...",
"E05NMBATH_d206": "After that kiss and Madison's manipulation, this could get worse.",
"E05NMBATH_d207": "Feels good, right? Being like this with me.",
"E05NMBATH_d208": "No men watching. Just us girls connecting in our special way.",
"E05NMBATH_d209": "Yeah... It feels really nice.",
"E05NMBATH_d210": "Your hands are so gentle, Maddie...",
"E05NMBATH_d211": "And this is normal, right? We don't need to do anything else.",
"E05NMBATH_d212": "Just pure friendship between women, the way it should be.",
"E05NMBATH_d213": "Yes... we are just best friends enjoying our bath.",
"E05NMBATH_d214": "So much better than having disgusting boys around.",
"E05NMBATH_d215": "Maddie, you're hurting me.",
"E05NMBATH_d216": "Your grip is too tight...",
"E05NMBATH_d217": "Sorry. I'll hug you gentler.",
"E05NMBATH_d218": "I just get excited being with someone as beautiful as you.",
"E05NMBATH_d219": "Someone who actually appreciates me, unlike my [fm_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d220": "Ah!",
"E05NMBATH_d221": "M-Maddie! What are you doing?",
"E05NMBATH_d222": "Your hand is...",
"E05NMBATH_d223": "I'm just washing your body.",
"E05NMBATH_d224": "These parts need special attention. They're so perfect.",
"E05NMBATH_d225": "You have a woman's body now, Nanami. So different from before.",
"E05NMBATH_d226": "But... You just pinched...",
"E05NMBATH_d227": "...my nipple.",
"E05NMBATH_d228": "We shouldn't be touching like this...",
"E05NMBATH_d229": "Madison's taking advantage of her.",
"E05NMBATH_d230": "Oh! Sorry! That wasn't on purpose! My fingers just slipped!",
"E05NMBATH_d231": "Don't be shy. Your body is reacting naturally.",
"E05NMBATH_d232": "Ehm... Ok.",
"E05NMBATH_d233": "If you say it's normal...",
"E05NMBATH_d234": "You're so cute, it makes me want to hear more.",
"E05NMBATH_d235": "The sounds you make when I touch you... so pure.",
"E05NMBATH_d236": "Wait... Ah!",
"E05NMBATH_d237": "Your fingers... they're... Ah!!",
"E05NMBATH_d238": "Maddie, this doesn't feel like just bathing anymore...",
"E05NMBATH_d239": "Trust me, Nanami. This is how women show affection.",
"E05NMBATH_d240": "Better than any boy could ever make you feel.",
"E05NMBATH_d241": "What she's doing to Nanami... this is wrong.",
"E05NMBATH_d242": "I should stop this, but if I suddenly appear...",
"E05NMBATH_d243": "Ah, [mc_name].",
"E05NMBATH_d244": "Seems like my [br_full_r_low] was peeping at us.",
"E05NMBATH_d245": "Did you enjoy the show, you pervert?",
"E05NMBATH_d246": "[mc_name]?! Oh no...",
"E05NMBATH_d247": "This isn't... I wasn't...",
"E05NMBATH_d248": "Madison, what the hell are you doing to her?",
"E05NMBATH_d249": "This isn't right and you know it.",
"E05NMBATH_d250": "How was that, dear [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05NMBATH_d251": "Did that turn you on?",
"E05NMBATH_d252": "Watching two women without their permission?",
"E05NMBATH_d253": "This isn't about me. It's about what you're doing to Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d254": "She's not some toy.",
"E05NMBATH_d255": "[br_full_r], join us!",
"E05NMBATH_d256": "Since I caught you watching, might as well participate.",
"E05NMBATH_d257": "Wait! What?",
"E05NMBATH_d258": "[mc_name], I didn't... this isn't what I...",
"E05NMBATH_d259": "Help me teach Nanami how to be a grown-up. It'll be a fun group lesson.",
"E05NMBATH_d260": "Or are you too much of a coward to do more than just watch?",
"E05NMBATH_d261": "Watch how I touch her... learn from this.",
"E05NMBATH_d262": "Nanami doesn't want this, Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d263": "Look at her face.",
"E05NMBATH_d264": "Ah!",
"E05NMBATH_d265": "Stop... Please...",
"E05NMBATH_d266": "[mc_name] is watching us... this is embarrassing...",
"E05NMBATH_d267": "Why? Does it feel bad?",
"E05NMBATH_d268": "Or are you just ashamed to let my [br_full_r_low] see how much you enjoy it?",
"E05NMBATH_d269": "Ahhh!",
"E05NMBATH_d270": "Men watch women all the time. Let him see what he's missing.",
"E05NMBATH_d271": "Ahhhhh!",
"E05NMBATH_d272": "I-It doesn't feel bad, it just....",
"E05NMBATH_d273": "It just feels weird.",
"E05NMBATH_d274": "I've never felt this way before...",
"E05NMBATH_d275": "Your turn, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d276": "Show Nanami what men really do to women.",
"E05NMBATH_d277": "Go on, don't be shy.",
"E05NMBATH_d278": "Prove me right about what disgusting creatures you all are.",
"E05NMBATH_d279": "She's challenging me... Does Madison always do this? Pushing boundaries to see who breaks first.",
"E05NMBATH_d280": "Maybe playing along will expose what she's really doing to Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d281": "Fine, I'll show you how men touch women.",
"E05NMBATH_d282": "Ah! [mc_name]! That hurts! You're too rough!",
"E05NMBATH_d283": "Your hands are squeezing too hard... please...",
"E05NMBATH_d284": "See how he grabs? No finesse. Just taking what he wants.",
"E05NMBATH_d285": "Men always hurt women. They can't help themselves.",
"E05NMBATH_d286": "I'm sorry Nanami, but I can't resist.",
"E05NMBATH_d287": "Your lips look so soft. I need to taste them.",
"E05NMBATH_d288": "Just one kiss. Let me show you what it feels like.",
"E05NMBATH_d289": "Wait!!",
"E05NMBATH_d290": "Please don't... not like this...",
"E05NMBATH_d291": "Now now, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d292": "We can't have that. No kissing.",
"E05NMBATH_d293": "Did you really think I'd let you kiss her? After I just kissed her myself?",
"E05NMBATH_d294": "That's for me to give, not a brute like you.",
"E05NMBATH_d295": "See? That's what men do, when they're alone with girls like you.",
"E05NMBATH_d296": "They hurt you, then try to force themselves on you when you're vulnerable.",
"E05NMBATH_d297": "That's what they're after. You understand now?",
"E05NMBATH_d298": "[mc_name]... I trusted you...",
"E05NMBATH_d299": "What the fuck?! Are you just toying with me?!",
"E05NMBATH_d300": "You set me up! You wanted me to do this!",
"E05NMBATH_d301": "No, no... don't get mad.",
"E05NMBATH_d302": "Your true nature revealed itself. I merely provided the opportunity.",
"E05NMBATH_d303": "This is what all men do when given the chance.",
"E05NMBATH_d304": "I was just showing how boys act around girls like Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d305": "They pretend to be gentle, then their hands turn to claws.",
"E05NMBATH_d306": "And that includes you too, [mc_name].",
"E05NMBATH_d307": "Did you see how rough he was, Nanami? How he tried to take what wasn't offered?",
"E05NMBATH_d308": "Now, be a good boy, and leave the bath, will you?",
"E05NMBATH_d309": "Fuck! She played me perfectly...",
"E05NMBATH_d310": "I became exactly what she wanted... a monster.",
"E05NMBATH_d311": "Nanami will never trust me now. I've proven Madison right.",
"E05NMBATH_d312": "There, there, Nanami. Your breasts must hurt from his rough handling.",
"E05NMBATH_d313": "Let me soothe them. Women know how to touch other women properly.",
"E05NMBATH_d314": "You were right about him, Maddie... I should have listened...",
"E05NMBATH_d315": "I won't be part of Madison's game.",
"E05NMBATH_d316": "She wants me to prove her point about men... Not happening.",
"E05NMBATH_d317": "Stop this, Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d318": "Using Nanami to get at me? That's low.",
"E05NMBATH_d319": "Excuse me?",
"E05NMBATH_d320": "Who do you think you are?",
"E05NMBATH_d321": "I saw what you did. The way you pressured her into this.",
"E05NMBATH_d322": "Mind your own business, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d323": "You wouldn't understand the connection between women.",
"E05NMBATH_d324": "Nanami, you don't have to do anything you don't want.",
"E05NMBATH_d325": "Don't let her pressure you. This isn't what friendship looks like.",
"E05NMBATH_d326": "You deserve better than being used in her games.",
"E05NMBATH_d327": "Shut up!",
"E05NMBATH_d328": "Don't listen to him, Nanami! He's trying to corrupt you!",
"E05NMBATH_d329": "I... I just wanted to take a bath...",
"E05NMBATH_d330": "I--I think I'd better head out...",
"E05NMBATH_d331": "No!! Where are you going?!",
"E05NMBATH_d332": "I... should get dressed...",
"E05NMBATH_d333": "After everything I've done for you? All the bullies I protected you from?",
"E05NMBATH_d334": "Please let go of my arm, Maddie... you're hurting me...",
"E05NMBATH_d335": "It's all your fault! You!! Get out, NOW!!",
"E05NMBATH_d336": "Leave us alone before you ruin everything else!",
"E05NMBATH_d337": "This is what men do, Nanami. They destroy everything beautiful.",
"E05NMBATH_d338": "Wait... I'll go too.",
"E05NMBATH_d339": "I don't... I don't think I should stay...",
"E05NMBATH_d340": "You're choosing him?",
"E05NMBATH_d341": "After everything I've taught you about men?",
"E05NMBATH_d342": "Nanami, you don't need me or Madison to make your own choices.",
"E05NMBATH_d343": "Trust your instincts. You know what feels right and what doesn't.",
"E05NMBATH_d344": "I... I think I need to stand up for myself...",
"E05NMBATH_d345": "I should go. This is between them now.",
"E05NMBATH_d346": "Maddie, please stop. This isn't what I want.",
"E05NMBATH_d347": "I don't like being used to prove your points about men.",
"E05NMBATH_d348": "You ungrateful little—after all I've done for you?",
"E05NMBATH_d349": "He's poisoned your mind already. Just like all men do.",

"E05ELBD_d001": "Pills for breakfast... lunch... dinner... my whole fucking life.",
"E05ELBD_d002": "Michael doesn't even hide what they're for anymore. 'Take these, Elizabeth. You're getting hysterical again.'",
"E05ELBD_d003": "Just... one more. Just to make the mirror less cruel.",
"E05ELBD_d004": "These aren't even working like they used to...",
"E05ELBD_d005": "White lingerie... so fucking ironic. The virgin bride I never was.",
"E05ELBD_d006": "Twenty years as decoration in this house. Twenty years as... the ornament on his shelf.",
"E05ELBD_d007": "Maybe... maybe if I try to look like I used to... maybe then...",
"E05ELBD_d008": "Who am I kidding? He never looked at me. Just through me.",
"E05ELBD_d009": "[mo_full_r] always said... always said... what was it? Beauty is... is currency.",
"E05ELBD_d010": "My only value... gone.",
"E05ELBD_d011": "Bankrupt. Fucking worthless now.",
"E05ELBD_d012": "Can't even remember... what I'm supposed to be thinking about...",
"E05ELBD_d013": "Orange... like sunset in Milan. Sunset on my worth.",
"E05ELBD_d014": "They called me The European Rose... now I'm just... just dried petals.",
"E05ELBD_d015": "The perfect color... Orange to match his ties at medical galas.",
"E05ELBD_d016": "Why can't I... why can't I make this body beautiful again?",
"E05ELBD_d017": "Naked... naked is easier. No more... pretending.",
"E05ELBD_d018": "Just meat on bones... just a body past its expiration date.",
"E05ELBD_d019": "All those eyes staring at me...",
"E05ELBD_d020": "Like I'm already a corpse.",
"E05ELBD_d021": "Pink... like my first Vogue cover. Fucking lifetime ago.",
"E05ELBD_d022": "These tits... these saggy, stretch-marked tits... used to make headlines.",
"E05ELBD_d023": "Now they're just... evidence. Evidence of decay.",
"E05ELBD_d024": "Maybe the wine will make me see what he saw. What everyone saw. Before...",
"E05ELBD_d025": "Red... always wore red in Milan. Red like... like...",
"E05ELBD_d026": "Like all that wine in my blood. Only thing real about me now.",

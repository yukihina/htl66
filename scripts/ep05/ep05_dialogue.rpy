"E05INTRO_d002": "At least the kitchen's empty. Small mercies.",
"E05INTRO_d003": "Where did [mo_r] hide the coffee this time?",
"E05INTRO_d004": "Found it. Behind the wine bottles. Classic Elizabeth.",
"E05INTRO_d005": "Could've used something stronger than coffee after yesterday...",
"E05INTRO_d006": "The sun's pretty nice today though. Maybe I should...",
"E05INTRO_d007": "Perfect. Coffee by the pool sounds good right now.",
"E05INTRO_d008": "Might help clear my head after all.",
"E05INTRO_d009": "What could possibly go wrong with a quiet morning coffee?",

"E05MADYOG_d000": "Oh, by the way - remember getting her drunk that night?",
"E05MADYOG_d001": "Okay, like this... smooth and gentle. Feel the stretch in your core.",
"E05MADYOG_d002": "Wow, you're amazing at this, Maddie! I wish I could move like that...",
"E05MADYOG_d003": "It just takes practice, sweetie. Stay with me and you'll get there.",
"E05MADYOG_d004": "I'll make sure you learn everything you need.",
"E05MADYOG_d005": "The secret is in the details. Watch how I position myself.",
"E05MADYOG_d006": "Um... I-Is this actually yoga? It looks different from the videos...",
"E05MADYOG_d007": "Trust your best friend, Nanami. I've been doing this way longer than those YouTube wannabes.",
"E05MADYOG_d008": "Besides, this is... a special kind of practice.",
"E05MADYOG_d009": "Now we stretch a little... wider.",
"E05MADYOG_d010": "M-Maddison! Are you sure?",
"E05MADYOG_d011": "Relax. Nobody's watching but me.",
"E05MADYOG_d012": "See how liberating this is?",
"E05MADYOG_d013": "It looks... intense.",
"E05MADYOG_d014": "You'll see how good it feels soon enough.",
"E05MADYOG_d015": "Want to give it a shot? I'll help you get into position.",
"E05MADYOG_d016": "I don't know... what if I fall over?",
"E05MADYOG_d017": "I won't let that happen. I've got you.",
"E05MADYOG_d018": "Always.",
"E05MADYOG_d019": "Eeeeh... Maddie... these clothes feel really tight...",
"E05MADYOG_d020": "They're supposed to be. Shows off your beautiful curves perfectly.",
"E05MADYOG_d021": "But everyone can see everything!",
"E05MADYOG_d022": "That's the whole point, silly.",
"E05MADYOG_d023": "Besides, it's just us here...",
"E05MADYOG_d024": "Here, let me help you get the position right...",
"E05MADYOG_d025": "M-Maddie... this is so embarrassing... what if someone sees?",
"E05MADYOG_d026": "Stop thinking so much. Just feel it.",
"E05MADYOG_d027": "Focus on my hands guiding you...",
"E05MADYOG_d028": "Let's see what you've got.",
"E05MADYOG_d029": "But I'm not ready...",
"E05MADYOG_d030": "You never are, and that's why it's fun.",
"E05MADYOG_d031": "Perfect form, Nanami. You're such a natural.",
"E05MADYOG_d032": "R-really? Thank you so much, Maddie!",
"E05MADYOG_d033": "Of course. You know I only want what's best for you.",
"E05MADYOG_d034": "We're going to get even closer...",
"E05MADYOG_d035": "Just need to adjust a few things...",
"E05MADYOG_d036": "Here... and here... feels good, right?",
"E05MADYOG_d037": "Y-yes... I think so...",
"E05MADYOG_d038": "Am I doing this correctly, Maddie?",
"E05MADYOG_d039": "Mmm... almost there. Just a bit more...",
"E05MADYOG_d040": "You're so responsive to my touch...",
"E05MADYOG_d041": "Your skin's gotten so soft lately...",
"E05MADYOG_d042": "I've been using that special lotion you bought me! Every night, just like you said!",
"E05MADYOG_d043": "Such a good girl... following all my instructions.",
"E05MADYOG_d044": "Now bring those legs closer together... trust me.",
"E05MADYOG_d045": "But the yoga book shows it differently...",
"E05MADYOG_d046": "Forget the book. This way feels much better, doesn't it?",
"E05MADYOG_d047": "I-is this the right position, Maddie?",
"E05MADYOG_d048": "You're such a perfect student... so eager to please...",
"E05MADYOG_d049": "Let me reward you...",
"E05MADYOG_d050": "This next pose needs special attention...",
"E05MADYOG_d051": "M-Madison! That's not... we shouldn't...",
"E05MADYOG_d052": "Shh... just relax. Let me take care of everything.",
"E05MADYOG_d053": "You know I only want what's best for you...",
"E05MADYOG_d054": "You're acting strange today...",
"E05MADYOG_d055": "Am I? Or are you just scared of getting closer to me?",
"E05MADYOG_d056": "I... I don't understand what you mean...",
"E05MADYOG_d057": "You will. Soon.",
"E05MADYOG_d058": "Now... copy my movements exactly, okay?",
"E05MADYOG_d059": "Like this? Am I doing okay?",
"E05MADYOG_d060": "Perfect. Can you feel how connected we are?",
"E05MADYOG_d061": "This is how it should always be...",
"E05MADYOG_d062": "You're mine to protect... to guide... to cherish.",
"E05MADYOG_d063": "Maddie... you're being intense again...",
"E05MADYOG_d064": "Let's take things further. You trust me, right?",
"E05MADYOG_d065": "I'll show you things you've never imagined...",
"E05MADYOG_d066": "Whatever they're doing... it's not my business. Better leave them alone.",
"E05MADYOG_d067": "Madison would just start another fight anyway...",
"E05MADYOG_d068": "And I really need my morning coffee...",
"E05MADYOG_d069": "Something's definitely wrong here. Madison's acting weird...",
"E05MADYOG_d070": "I should check on Nanami. This doesn't look right.",
"E05MADYOG_d071": "Hey... what's going on out here?",
"E05MADYOG_d072": "[mc_name]! It's not what it looks like! Maddie's teaching me some morning stretches!",
"E05MADYOG_d073": "We're in the middle of something. Get lost, pervert.",
"E05MADYOG_d074": "Teaching? That looked more like groping to me.",
"E05MADYOG_d075": "Nobody asked for your opinion.",
"E05MADYOG_d076": "It's a special technique Maddie invented! Right, Maddie?",
"E05MADYOG_d077": "Ignore him, Nanami. He's just jealous he can't join in.",
"E05MADYOG_d078": "Men always want to ruin everything...",
"E05MADYOG_d079": "Keep going sweetie, you're doing so well.",
"E05MADYOG_d080": "O-okay, Maddie! If you say so...",
"E05MADYOG_d081": "That's my girl. So obedient...",
"E05MADYOG_d082": "Let me handle this asshole. Don't stop practicing.",
"E05MADYOG_d083": "Uhm... please don't fight...",
"E05MADYOG_d084": "Just a quick chat between siblings. Right, [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05MADYOG_d085": "Seriously, what's your problem now?",
"E05MADYOG_d086": "Can't you see we're busy here? Go jerk off somewhere else.",
"E05MADYOG_d087": "Cut the act. That's not yoga and you know it.",
"E05MADYOG_d088": "Oh? And what exactly do you think it is?",
"E05MADYOG_d089": "You're manipulating her. She trusts you and you're taking advantage.",
"E05MADYOG_d090": "Aww, is big [br_full_r_low] playing white knight now? How noble.",
"E05MADYOG_d091": "Don't pretend you weren't enjoying the show, pervert.",
"E05MADYOG_d092": "I'm not a pervert. Just looking out for her.",
"E05MADYOG_d093": "Right. Because creeping on young girls is totally normal...",
"E05MADYOG_d094": "What are you talking about?",
"E05MADYOG_d095": "Look at you... acting all righteous while undressing her with your eyes.",
"E05MADYOG_d096": "You're just like every other man - thinking with your dick.",
"E05MADYOG_d097": "What the hell are you talking about?",
"E05MADYOG_d098": "Don't play dumb. It's pathetic.",
"E05MADYOG_d099": "I see everything in this house, remember? Every little interaction...",
"E05MADYOG_d100": "I barely know her! We've only talked like twice!",
"E05MADYOG_d101": "Always excuses with you men, isn't it?",
"E05MADYOG_d102": "You know who you remind me of right now?",
"E05MADYOG_d103": "Dear old [daddy_r]. King of excuses himself.",
"E05MADYOG_d104": "Madison-",
"E05MADYOG_d105": "Wonder what he's doing in his office right now? More 'late night surgeries'?",
"E05MADYOG_d106": "I don't care what he does.",
"E05MADYOG_d107": "Of course not. Because we don't care what anyone does in this [fm_r_low], do we?",
"E05MADYOG_d108": "What does he have to do with you basically molesting Nanami?",
"E05MADYOG_d109": "'Molesting'? Please. I'm helping her grow.",
"E05MADYOG_d110": "Teaching her confidence. Something you wouldn't understand.",
"E05MADYOG_d111": "That wasn't confidence - it was control.",
"E05MADYOG_d112": "And? What's wrong with that? Let me tell you a story, dear [br_full_r_low].",
"E05MADYOG_d113": "About a little redhead who learned life's hardest lesson...",
"E05MADYOG_d114": "Madison, I just want my coffee.",
"E05MADYOG_d115": "You'll listen whether you like it or not.",
"E05MADYOG_d116": "Once upon a time, there was a girl who lived in a big house.",
"E05MADYOG_d117": "She thought it was her castle, but it was more like a cage.",
"E05MADYOG_d118": "She watched her [mo_r] get slapped around every night. When she tried to help? Guess what happened?",
"E05MADYOG_d119": "She got slapped, too.",
"E05MADYOG_d120": "Madison, stop—",
"E05MADYOG_d121": "No interrupting! Stories have rules.",
"E05MADYOG_d122": "[mo_r] called her a nuisance. Told her to go away.",
"E05MADYOG_d123": "Why are you telling me this?",
"E05MADYOG_d124": "Because you need to understand why things are this way.",
"E05MADYOG_d125": "That good little girl? She died that night. Learned something important.",
"E05MADYOG_d126": "Being good gets you hurt. Being bad? That's how you survive.",
"E05MADYOG_d127": "I had no idea...",
"E05MADYOG_d128": "You like her, don't you? Our precious little Nanami...",
"E05MADYOG_d129": "Don't worry. I like her too. Different kind of like though.",
"E05MADYOG_d130": "It's not like that at all...",
"E05MADYOG_d131": "Just look at her... so pure, so innocent.",
"E05MADYOG_d132": "What do you see when you look at her? Nice tits? Cute face? Bet you've thought about it...",
"E05MADYOG_d133": "I don't-",
"E05MADYOG_d134": "Shut up. We both know that's exactly what you see.",
"E05MADYOG_d135": "Want to know what I see? Everything. The girl crying in bathroom stalls.",
"E05MADYOG_d136": "The one apologizing for breathing. My precious little Nanami...",
"E05MADYOG_d137": "She's grown so much with me, but inside? Still that scared bunny. She needs me.",
"E05MADYOG_d138": "Want to hear how we met? It's quite the story.",
"E05MADYOG_d139": "Do I have a choice in this?",
"E05MADYOG_d140": "Found her locked in the school bathroom. Crying her eyes out.",
"E05MADYOG_d141": "Called her pathetic, slapped her, told her to grow up. She looked at me like I'd kicked a puppy. It was adorable.",
"E05MADYOG_d142": "That's... horrible.",
"E05MADYOG_d143": "Next day? Her bullies vanished. One got expelled. Others... learned their lesson.",
"E05MADYOG_d144": "What did you do to them?",
"E05MADYOG_d145": "Protected what's mine. She's been following me ever since.",
"E05MADYOG_d146": "Like a lost puppy finding its owner...",
"E05MADYOG_d147": "You're not ruining this. She needs me. She belongs to me.",
"E05MADYOG_d148": "Get it through your thick skull, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05MADYOG_d149": "She's not your property!",
"E05MADYOG_d150": "Oh please. Like you know anything about her.",
"E05MADYOG_d151": "Look at you playing hero. It's honestly pathetic.",
"E05MADYOG_d152": "You don't know the first thing about her. Just projecting your sick fantasies.",
"E05MADYOG_d153": "That's bullshit! You're the one who's sick!",
"E05MADYOG_d154": "Am I? You think she needs you? That she sees you the way you see her?",
"E05MADYOG_d155": "I'm her everything. Her protector. Her confidante. Her salvation.",
"E05MADYOG_d156": "Do you even know what it feels like to be with a woman?",
"E05MADYOG_d157": "Are we really having this conversation?",
"E05MADYOG_d158": "Look at her... all you see is eye candy. But I see her soul.",
"E05MADYOG_d159": "You're sick for even suggesting that.",
"E05MADYOG_d160": "No, [br_full_r_low]. You're the sick one. This is real love. Pure love.",
"E05MADYOG_d161": "Not your twisted male fantasy version of it.",
"E05MADYOG_d162": "This is why women are superior. We see the whole picture.",
"E05MADYOG_d163": "Your dick only sees half the story. We see love in its purest form.",
"E05MADYOG_d164": "That's what makes us more human than you'll ever be.",
"E05MADYOG_d165": "Jesus Christ... I just wanted some breakfast.",
"E05MADYOG_d166": "I'm out of here.",
"E05MADYOG_d167": "Running away? Typical man.",
"E05MADYOG_d168": "That's right. Leave. Men never want to face reality.",
"E05MADYOG_d169": "This is exactly why Nanami needs someone like me.",
"E05MADYOG_d170": "Someone who'll stay. Who'll protect her.",
"E05MADYOG_d171": "Oh, by the way - remember keeping her up late that night?",
"E05MADYOG_d172": "She told me everything. 'Maddie, your [br_full_r_low] touched me...'",
"E05MADYOG_d173": "Nobody touches what's mine. Remember that.",
"E05MADYOG_d174": "Go fuck yourself!",
"E05MADYOG_d175": "Oh look! Perfect timing - Nanami's shower time!",
"E05MADYOG_d176": "Nanami! Ready for your morning routine?",
"E05MADYOG_d177": "Don't forget to use that special soap I got you...",
"E05MADYOG_d178": "Thanks for the amazing lesson, Maddie! It was really fun!",
"E05MADYOG_d179": "Anything for you, sweetie.",
"E05MADYOG_d180": "I'm gonna go shower now, okay?",
"E05MADYOG_d181": "Go ahead.",
"E05MADYOG_d182": "Now then, dear [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05MADYOG_d183": "Let's discuss keeping secrets, shall we?",
"E05MADYOG_d184": "[fm_r] secrets are the best kind...",
"E05MADYOG_d185": "What are you-",
"E05MADYOG_d186": "Shh... just taking a little insurance policy.",
"E05MADYOG_d187": "Say cheese, big [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05MADYOG_d188": "Behave, or everyone sees this lovely topless pic of me with their favorite pervert.",
"E05MADYOG_d189": "Wonder what Nanami or Isabella would think?",
"E05MADYOG_d190": "Delete that right now!",
"E05MADYOG_d191": "Not happening. Be a good boy and maybe I won't share them.",
"E05MADYOG_d192": "Your reputation is in my hands now...",
"E05MADYOG_d193": "Perfect blackmail material...",
"E05MADYOG_d194": "Have fun dying alone, [br_full_r_low] dear.",
"E05MADYOG_d195": "Now if you'll excuse me, Nanami needs help washing her back...",
"E05MADYOG_d196": "Now that Nanami is gone, don't forget you owe me a favor. Remember the photo, right? We'll talk later.",

"E05AMBERCOF_d001": "Coffee time.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d002": "Always right after her streams...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d003": "Stream's done?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d004": "Just finished. Gonna chill now.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d005": "She seems less aggressive than usual...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d006": "Maybe I should say something about last time...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d007": "She looks tired... might be a good moment.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d008": "Maybe I should try to make things right...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d009": "About last time...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d010": "Save it. I don't do apologies.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d011": "Classic Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d012": "I was wrong.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d013": "Yeah, you were. Don't do it again.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d014": "... but thanks for saying it.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d015": "Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d016": "You're blocking the coffee maker.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d017": "Guess she's still mad...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d018": "The tension is unbearable...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d019": "[da_r]? Can you come to my room? I need to talk to you...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d020": "Saved by Isabella...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d021": "You look tense. Madison giving you trouble?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d022": "No more than usual. Just... dealing with things.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d023": "She's such a little bitch sometimes...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d024": "Hmm.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d025": "Want to talk about it?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d026": "I'm just realizing how little control we really have. Even when we try to do what's right.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d027": "That's deep for a morning chat.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d028": "Yeah. Just thinking aloud.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d029": "You always overthink everything...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d030": "Well, don't think too hard. Life's easier that way.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d031": "I'll keep that in mind.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d032": "Let me help you forget all that crap...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d033": "Want me to help you relax?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d034": "I've got just the thing.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d035": "What do you mean?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d036": "Let's just say, it'll take your mind off things.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d037": "Here? Someone could-",
"E05AMBERCOF_d038": "That's what makes it fun.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d039": "Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d040": "Scared someone will see us?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d041": "Or that you won't be able to stop yourself?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d042": "We shouldn't be doing this... at least not here or even at this time...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d043": "No? Then why are you watching me so closely?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d044": "She's got a point...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d045": "Like what you see?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d046": "Nervous?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d047": "Or excited?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d048": "Someone could come in any second...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d049": "Mmm...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d050": "Like Madison? Or sweet little Isabella?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d051": "You know... The risk is half the fun.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d052": "Where do you want it?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d053": "Upstairs? My room?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d054": "Amber... we can't...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d055": "This is crazy... but...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d056": "Alright.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d057": "That's what I like to hear...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d058": "You're going to get us in trouble...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d059": "We really shouldn't...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d060": "We can't keep doing this, Amber.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d061": "Fine. Be boring.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d062": "Whatever. I just wanted coffee anyway.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d063": "She's really upset...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d064": "[da_r]? Can you come to my room? I need to talk to you...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d065": "Shhh... wouldn't want anyone hearing...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d066": "We shouldn't-",
"E05AMBERCOF_d067": "Stop thinking so much...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d068": "Shut up and watch me.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d069": "She's so demanding...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d070": "I know you want to...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d071": "Does this catch your eye?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d072": "Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d073": "Just say yes...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d074": "I can feel how much you want this...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d075": "We shouldn't...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d076": "But we will...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d077": "Shouldn't what? This?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d078": "Someone could walk in...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d079": "Scared? Or turned on?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d080": "Then we better make it quick...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d081": "Come here...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d082": "Fuck... you're so wet...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d083": "All for you, big [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d084": "The way she says that...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d085": "Now, do it! Quick!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d086": "You want me to...?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d087": "Fuck me!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d088": "Stop teasing and put it in already...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d089": "So impatient...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d090": "Please... I need it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d091": "Just the tip? Really?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d092": "You like it slow... right?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d093": "Fuck slow, I want all of it!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d094": "Stop being gentle...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d095": "Make me...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d096": "You asked for it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d097": "Tell me how good it feels...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d098": "So fucking good...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d099": "Harder... fuck me harder!",

"E05AMBERCOF_d103": "Don't stop... please don't stop...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d104": "Right there... yes!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d105": "You feel amazing...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d106": "Keep going... just like that...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d107": "You're so tight...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d108": "All yours... I'm all yours...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d109": "Keep fucking me...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d110": "She's getting close...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d111": "Don't you dare slow down...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d112": "I'm close...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d113": "Me too...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d114": "Together... let's cum together...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d115": "Yes! Just like that!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d116": "Amber... I can't hold it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d117": "Don't hold back... give it to me...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d118": "You're squeezing me so tight...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d119": "I'm gonna cum... gonna cum...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d120": "Fuck yes! Don't stop!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d121": "So close...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d122": "Me too... me too...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d123": "Wait! Wait! Wait!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d124": "What!!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d125": "You know what would be fun? Giving my coffee a special... creamer.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d126": "That's...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d127": "Perverted? That's the point.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d128": "But...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d129": "Shut up and do it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d130": "Come for me, big [br_full_r_low].",
"E05AMBERCOF_d131": "Do it.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d132": "You're crazy...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d133": "Oh god...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d134": "Come on, give my coffee what it needs...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d135": "This girl is unbelievable...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d136": "You're fucking insane, you know that?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d137": "You love it though...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d138": "God help me, I do...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d139": "Fuck, fuck, fuck!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d140": "Yes... give it all to me...",

"E05AMBERCOF_d142": "That's it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d143": "Holy shit...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d144": "Perfect...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d145": "Now that's a proper drink.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d146": "She's really going to...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d147": "Cheers...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d148": "She's actually stirring it in...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d149": "The perfect blend...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d150": "You're something else...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d151": "Mmm... much better than the store-bought stuff.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d152": "You're insane.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d153": "You mean creative...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d154": "You love it. So, feeling better now?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d155": "Yeah... yeah, actually.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d156": "Told you I'd help...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d157": "Yummy!",
"E05AMBERCOF_d158": "Best coffee I've had all week...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d159": "The way she licks her lips...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d160": "Alright! Now just let me fix my clothes...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d161": "That was intense...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d162": "What, getting shy now after all that?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d163": "We really need to be careful...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d164": "What's life without a little risk?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d165": "Finally got to swallow instead of wearing it...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d166": "Jesus, Amber...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d167": "By the way, for future reference, I can swallow but never ever do it on my face. It's just a pain to clean up.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d168": "Good to know.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d169": "Good to know.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d170": "Let's clean this jizz before I go.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d171": "Well, that's my morning pick-me-up done. Better than caffeine, right?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d172": "Yeah... thanks, Amber.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d173": "Anytime, big [br_full_r_low]...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d174": "Oh, by the way - Elizabeth's been popping pills again. More than usual.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d175": "How do you know?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d176": "She's not exactly subtle...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d177": "Hard to miss the rattling when she walks by. Plus Isabella's been hovering around her door like a concerned little nurse.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d178": "Isabella?",
"E05AMBERCOF_d179": "Your [dau_r_low] notices more than you think...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d180": "Yeah, she's got quite the observation skills.",
"E05AMBERCOF_d181": "Just like her [mo_full_r_low]...",
"E05AMBERCOF_d182": "Better keep an eye on both of them...",

"E05ISACOS_d001": "Let's go in, [da_r]. I need to show you something important.",
"E05ISACOS_d002": "She never asks me to her room...",
"E05ISACOS_d003": "Please hurry, it's about [gra_r]...",
"E05ISACOS_d004": "Isabella, it's me... [mc_name]",
"E05ISACOS_d005": "Come in, [da_r]. I've been wanting to talk to you.",
"E05ISACOS_d006": "She sounds worried...",
"E05ISACOS_d007": "Lock the door, [daddy_r]. What we need to discuss should stay private.",
"E05ISACOS_d008": "What's on your mind?",
"E05ISACOS_d009": "She's never this secretive...",
"E05ISACOS_d010": "About [gra_r] Elizabeth. I've been watching her, studying her behavior...",
"E05ISACOS_d011": "What about her?",
"E05ISACOS_d012": "I've seen the bottles in her room, [da_r]. So many pills... different colors, different names.",
"E05ISACOS_d013": "Her pills? What do you mean?",
"E05ISACOS_d014": "It's just... you weren't here, [da_r]. These past few years have been rough. [grf_short_r] keeps giving her all these pills, saying they'll help, but...",
"E05ISACOS_d015": "Some days she's like a zombie, just sitting there. And when she skips them, she's either crying or throwing up in the bathroom.",
"E05ISACOS_d016": "Uhm...",
"E05ISACOS_d017": "I think she needs to see another doctor, [da_r]. Someone who actually wants to help her get better.",
"E05ISACOS_d018": "Because honestly? It feels like [grf_short_r]'s just playing around with her meds.",
"E05ISACOS_d019": "Every time she starts feeling better, he gives her more stuff until she's worse than before.",
"E05ISACOS_d020": "Michael... what are you doing to her?",
"E05ISACOS_d021": "I'm gonna talk to her about this.",
"E05ISACOS_d022": "Thanks, [daddy_r]. Let's keep an eye on her, okay?",
"E05ISACOS_d023": "I'm scared something bad might happen...",
"E05ISACOS_d024": "Okay, Sweetheart. Changing the subject, can I ask what you are doing?",
"E05ISACOS_d025": "What do you mean, [daddy_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d026": "Your clothes... is that lingerie?",
"E05ISACOS_d027": "Oh... this? It's the base layer for Commander White's outfit.",
"E05ISACOS_d028": "Commander who?",
"E05ISACOS_d029": "At least it's for cosplay...",
"E05ISACOS_d030": "From NieR:Automata! You know, the beautiful commander with white hair?",
"E05ISACOS_d031": "Still... isn't it a bit revealing for a base layer?",
"E05ISACOS_d032": "Even if it's accurate, it's too much...",
"E05ISACOS_d033": "But it has to be exact! Her outfit is all about the details...",
"E05ISACOS_d034": "No, I don't like it... it's still inappropriate.",
"E05ISACOS_d035": "The Commander's outfit wasn't this revealing, was it?",
"E05ISACOS_d036": "But [daddy_r], her uniform needs this foundation! The structure is important.",
"E05ISACOS_d037": "See the regal-style lace? It's specifically designed for her look.",
"E05ISACOS_d038": "Well... It looks regal... I think so, but please tell me there's more to the costume.",
"E05ISACOS_d039": "Of course! We still need the coat, boots, and everything else!",
"E05ISACOS_d040": "Commander White's uniform is really complex. All these pieces have to go on in the right order.",
"E05ISACOS_d041": "Oh thank god. For a moment there, Sweetheart, you had me worried.",
"E05ISACOS_d042": "Still... seeing you in something so mature, it just reminded me that you're growing up, and it's just... strange, that's all.",
"E05ISACOS_d043": "Shhh... Don't say that, [da_r]. You're making me blush...",
"E05ISACOS_d044": "I'll always be your little girl. No matter what...",
"E05ISACOS_d045": "Why does that sound different now...",
"E05ISACOS_d046": "Hey... could you help me with something? I need help getting dressed properly.",
"E05ISACOS_d047": "The costume's not done yet... there are some parts I can't reach...",
"E05ISACOS_d048": "What's missing, Sweetheart?",
"E05ISACOS_d049": "Can't you tell? Look closer...",
"E05ISACOS_d050": "Uhmm... nope?",
"E05ISACOS_d051": "Well... Look carefully and tell me what's missing! The character always wears specific accessories...",
"E05ISACOS_d052": "Uhmm...",
"E05ISACOS_d053": "She's waiting for an answer... what should I do?",
"E05ISACOS_d054": "Something's still not right though. Can you tell what it is, [da_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d055": "The... uhm... the bottom part looks incomplete...",
"E05ISACOS_d056": "Focus on the costume, not my body...",
"E05ISACOS_d057": "Look carefully, [daddy_r]. The character wears something special over this...",
"E05ISACOS_d058": "Feel how exposed the lace is? It needs something over it, right?",
"E05ISACOS_d059": "Her body's looks so fragile...",
"E05ISACOS_d060": "Think fashion, [da_r]. What covers but still shows skin?",
"E05ISACOS_d061": "A jacket?",
"E05ISACOS_d062": "Please let that be the right answer...",
"E05ISACOS_d063": "Yes! And thigh-high boots too! Will you help me put them on?",
"E05ISACOS_d064": "Sure, just tell me what to do.",
"E05ISACOS_d065": "At least we're getting somewhere safe...",
"E05ISACOS_d066": "Running away, [daddy_r]? When I need your help most...",
"E05ISACOS_d067": "Can't you tell how excited I am to show you? My heart's racing...",
"E05ISACOS_d068": "She's being too forward...",
"E05ISACOS_d069": "Isabella, this isn't-",
"E05ISACOS_d070": "Just help me with Commander White's jacket. That's all I want...",
"E05ISACOS_d071": "I should go...",
"E05ISACOS_d072": "The uniform needs that military jacket, [daddy_r]... to complete the look.",
"E05ISACOS_d073": "That's not appropriate...",
"E05ISACOS_d074": "Why not? I picked this costume specially for you...",
"E05ISACOS_d075": "Please? You owe me at least this much. Remember how you never helped me dress up in the past?",
"E05ISACOS_d076": "You know I can't say no when you look at me like that.",
"E05ISACOS_d077": "When did she learn to be so manipulative...",
"E05ISACOS_d078": "D-[daddy_r_low]... what are you...",
"E05ISACOS_d079": "The regal details on this lace are interesting...",
"E05ISACOS_d080": "She wasn't expecting this...",
"E05ISACOS_d081": "Wait... your hands...",
"E05ISACOS_d082": "Commander White's uniform needs careful inspection...",
"E05ISACOS_d083": "I... um... you're being different...",
"E05ISACOS_d084": "That's not... I mean... you're so close...",
"E05ISACOS_d085": "The base layer is quite revealing...",
"E05ISACOS_d086": "I didn't expect you to... notice so much...",
"E05ISACOS_d087": "[daddy_r], you're making me nervous...",
"E05ISACOS_d088": "The jacket will cover all this, right?",
"E05ISACOS_d089": "Her skin's burning under my touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d090": "Y-yes! The military jacket! It's over there...",
"E05ISACOS_d091": "Should I... get it?",
"E05ISACOS_d092": "Let me help you into it.",
"E05ISACOS_d093": "Okay, [da_r]... Let me get it.",
"E05ISACOS_d094": "She's still nervous from my touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d095": "Right... the jacket...",
"E05ISACOS_d096": "Okay, I got it. It's heavier than I expected...",
"E05ISACOS_d097": "Please, [daddy_r]? The shoulders are structured...",
"E05ISACOS_d098": "Focus on helping her with the uniform...",
"E05ISACOS_d099": "How should I help with this...",
"E05ISACOS_d100": "Hold it open for me... it's pretty stiff...",
"E05ISACOS_d101": "The details on this are impressive...",
"E05ISACOS_d102": "The shoulders need to sit just right...",
"E05ISACOS_d103": "At least this is covering more skin...",
"E05ISACOS_d104": "Like this? The shoulders look even now.",
"E05ISACOS_d105": "Yes... perfect... you're good at this...",
"E05ISACOS_d106": "Almost done...",
"E05ISACOS_d107": "D-[daddy_r_low]... your hands...",
"E05ISACOS_d108": "The jacket's heavy but she's so warm...",
"E05ISACOS_d109": "Stay still...",
"E05ISACOS_d110": "Why am I touching her like this...",
"E05ISACOS_d111": "The uniform... you're not really focusing on it...",
"E05ISACOS_d112": "She knows exactly what I'm doing...",
"E05ISACOS_d113": "I didn't know helping with cosplay would be like this...",
"E05ISACOS_d114": "I should stop... but I can't...",
"E05ISACOS_d115": "Now for the boots... they're crucial for Commander White.",
"E05ISACOS_d116": "Those distinctive white boots...",
"E05ISACOS_d117": "They're quite tall, like hers...",
"E05ISACOS_d118": "Help me with these? They're not easy to put on...",
"E05ISACOS_d119": "This part of the costume...",
"E05ISACOS_d120": "Sure... let's get them on.",
"E05ISACOS_d121": "They go up past my knees... just like in the game...",
"E05ISACOS_d122": "Keep it professional... it's just cosplay...",
"E05ISACOS_d123": "The buckles are tricky...",
"E05ISACOS_d124": "These do look complicated...",
"E05ISACOS_d125": "Start from the bottom... work your way up...",
"E05ISACOS_d126": "The other one needs the same... keep them even...",
"E05ISACOS_d127": "Focus on the task, not her legs...",
"E05ISACOS_d128": "Guide my hands... show me how...",
"E05ISACOS_d129": "L-like this? From ankle to thigh...",
"E05ISACOS_d130": "Her skin's so warm...",
"E05ISACOS_d131": "The buckles... they need to be tight...",
"E05ISACOS_d132": "Other side too... make them match...",
"E05ISACOS_d133": "Every touch feels dangerous...",
"E05ISACOS_d134": "They're snug... like they should be...",
"E05ISACOS_d135": "The white leather against her skin...",
"E05ISACOS_d136": "Just the skirt left... to complete her look...",
"E05ISACOS_d137": "Final piece...",
"E05ISACOS_d138": "The white skirt! Last piece...",
"E05ISACOS_d139": "Keep it professional... almost done...",
"E05ISACOS_d140": "These boots make standing difficult...",
"E05ISACOS_d141": "Help me step into it...",
"E05ISACOS_d142": "Just like a regular skirt...",
"E05ISACOS_d143": "Do I look like her? Like Commander White?",
"E05ISACOS_d144": "She's really getting into character...",
"E05ISACOS_d145": "The skirt's the final touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d146": "Let me help you into it... slowly...",
"E05ISACOS_d147": "One last chance to touch...",
"E05ISACOS_d148": "How do I look?",
"E05ISACOS_d149": "Need to check everything...",
"E05ISACOS_d150": "Inspect carefully, [daddy_r]...",
"E05ISACOS_d151": "Final inspection...",
"E05ISACOS_d152": "Fuck... that slit in the skirt... I can see everything...",
"E05ISACOS_d153": "The boots make the uniform look authentic, right?",
"E05ISACOS_d154": "Those thighs... the way her lips peek through...",
"E05ISACOS_d155": "Even with the jacket... her nipples are so visible through the lace...",
"E05ISACOS_d156": "The material's really high quality! Just like in the reference...",
"E05ISACOS_d157": "God... the way it clings to her body...",
"E05ISACOS_d158": "That innocent smile... she has no idea what she does to me...",
"E05ISACOS_d159": "Did I capture Commander White's essence, [daddy_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d160": "My beautiful little girl... when did you grow up so much...",
"E05ISACOS_d161": "Well? What do you think, [daddy_r]?",
"E05ISACOS_d162": "I don't know much about Commander White, but you look stunning, Princess.",
"E05ISACOS_d163": "She's jumping into my arms...",
"E05ISACOS_d164": "You're the best, [daddy_r]! Thank you for helping!",
"E05ISACOS_d165": "Her whole body's pressed against me...",
"E05ISACOS_d166": "Isab-mmph!",
"E05ISACOS_d167": "Mmm...",
"E05ISACOS_d168": "Her lips... she's actually kissing me again...",
"E05ISACOS_d169": "Her lips... she's actually kissing me...",
"E05ISACOS_d170": "Oh god... I... I got too excited...",
"E05ISACOS_d171": "Uhm.... she's covering her face in embarrassment...",
"E05ISACOS_d172": "Isabella...",
"E05ISACOS_d173": "Maybe you should check on [gra_r] now...",
"E05ISACOS_d174": "I'll visit her later... after I finish the cosplay...",
"E05ISACOS_d175": "Of course, Princess.",
"E05ISACOS_d176": "What have I awakened in her...",

"E05ELIZIN_d001": "[mo_r]'s door is open...",
"E05ELIZIN_d002": "She never leaves it open...",
"E05ELIZIN_d003": "What's going on?",
"E05ELIZIN_d004": "Huh? She's just sitting there in her babydoll... staring at the floor...",
"E05ELIZIN_d005": "Ever since I got here, she's been like this. Lost. Empty.",
"E05ELIZIN_d006": "The light in her eyes is gone...",
"E05ELIZIN_d007": "So many bottles of pills...",
"E05ELIZIN_d008": "Different colors, different labels... scattered everywhere.",
"E05ELIZIN_d009": "[da_r]'s prescriptions... what are you doing to her?",
"E05ELIZIN_d010": "Huh?! What the-- when did she-? She's behind me...",
"E05ELIZIN_d011": "Her makeup's all smeared... has she been crying?",
"E05ELIZIN_d012": "She's just staring at herself in the mirror...",
"E05ELIZIN_d013": "[mo_r]?",
"E05ELIZIN_d014": "She's picking up more pills... swallowing them dry...",
"E05ELIZIN_d015": "Like they're candy...",
"E05ELIZIN_d016": "[mc_name]...?",
"E05ELIZIN_d017": "That smile... but those eyes are drowning in tears...",
"E05ELIZIN_d018": "When did you come in, sweetie?",
"E05ELIZIN_d019": "She's trying so hard to look okay...",
"E05ELIZIN_d020": "You should've told me you were coming to visit...",
"E05ELIZIN_d021": "Her words are slurring...",
"E05ELIZIN_d022": "Sit with me, darling... tell me about your day...",
"E05ELIZIN_d023": "[mo_r], I'm worried about you...",
"E05ELIZIN_d024": "Come here... let me hold you...",
"E05ELIZIN_d025": "Her body's so warm against mine...",
"E05ELIZIN_d026": "My sweet boy... you've grown so strong...",
"E05ELIZIN_d027": "My hands shouldn't be here... but I can't help it...",
"E05ELIZIN_d028": "Look at you... my handsome [so_r_low]...",
"E05ELIZIN_d029": "That smile... it's real this time...",
"E05ELIZIN_d030": "But something's wrong...",
"E05ELIZIN_d031": "[mo_r]... what's happening to you?",
"E05ELIZIN_d032": "Everything's perfect now... just like before...",

"E05ELIPAST_d001": "Stupid derivatives... stupid school...",
"E05ELIPAST_d002": "Damnit, what the hell is this? Why do they make math so complicated...",
"E05ELIPAST_d003": "If I don't finish this by tomorrow, I'm totally screwed for the test.",
"E05ELIPAST_d004": "Uhm... great! Now she's gonna scold me for sure!",
"E05ELIPAST_d005": "Such frustration in my precious boy...",
"E05ELIPAST_d006": "What's this? Calculus giving you trouble again?",
"E05ELIPAST_d007": "You look so adorably lost, sweetheart.",
"E05ELIPAST_d008": "[mo_r], please. I'm trying to concentrate here.",
"E05ELIPAST_d009": "Oh? Am I distracting you?",
"E05ELIPAST_d010": "I thought my brilliant [so_r_low] could handle a little... help.",
"E05ELIPAST_d011": "Just... this test tomorrow...",
"E05ELIPAST_d012": "My poor darling. Math always was your weakness.",
"E05ELIPAST_d013": "Good thing [mommy_r_low] knows just how to make it... click for you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d014": "Let [mommy_r_low] teach you...",
"E05ELIPAST_d015": "These late-night galas are so dreadfully boring. I'd much rather be here with you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d016": "Ehhh... These functions are impossible...",
"E05ELIPAST_d017": "She smells like champagne and that perfume she got from Paris.",
"E05ELIPAST_d018": "Nothing's impossible with proper... instruction.",
"E05ELIPAST_d019": "See, integration is all about finding what's hidden beneath the surface.",
"E05ELIPAST_d020": "Something I've always been rather good at, wouldn't you say?",
"E05ELIPAST_d021": "Don't react... don't react...",
"E05ELIPAST_d022": "Focus on the math, not how her breath feels against my ear.",
"E05ELIPAST_d023": "So, let's look at this integral... see how you can solve it step by step?",
"E05ELIPAST_d024": "The trick is knowing exactly when to... push forward and when to hold back.",
"E05ELIPAST_d025": "Just like in life, darling. Timing is everything.",
"E05ELIPAST_d026": "Focus, [mc_name]... just... don't think about [mo_r_low]'s... dress...",
"E05ELIPAST_d027": "God, why does she always do this after her parties?",
"E05ELIPAST_d028": "It's all about... tension...",
"E05ELIPAST_d029": "The delicate balance between variables. Between what we want and what we're allowed.",
"E05ELIPAST_d030": "Are you following me, sweetie?",
"E05ELIPAST_d031": "[mo_r], I can't focus when you're...",
"E05ELIPAST_d032": "When I'm what, darling?",
"E05ELIPAST_d033": "Using real-world applications to make your studies more... engaging?",
"E05ELIPAST_d034": "Or is it that you prefer your textbooks dry and boring?",
"E05ELIPAST_d035": "T-teaching like this...",
"E05ELIPAST_d036": "It's just... distracting.",
"E05ELIPAST_d037": "Don't think about [mommy_r_low] too much, sweetie.",
"E05ELIPAST_d038": "Eyes on your paper. Though I can't help but notice yours keep... wandering.",
"E05ELIPAST_d039": "Now, let's talk about limits...",
"E05ELIPAST_d040": "My favorite part of calculus, actually.",
"E05ELIPAST_d041": "Limits? Uh, yeah... like when something approaches but doesn't...",
"E05ELIPAST_d042": "When a function gets closer and closer to a value but never quite...",
"E05ELIPAST_d043": "She's practically sitting in my lap now. This is torture.",
"E05ELIPAST_d044": "Exactly... approaching, getting so close, just not crossing that line...",
"E05ELIPAST_d045": "The mathematics of temptation, wouldn't you say?",
"E05ELIPAST_d046": "Just like we are now... so close...",
"E05ELIPAST_d047": "I could practically solve this problem with my eyes closed. Want to see?",
"E05ELIPAST_d048": "Or would you rather just watch me, hmm?",
"E05ELIPAST_d049": "Oh God, this can't be happening...",
"E05ELIPAST_d050": "That's definitely not her perfume I'm smelling now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d051": "You know, in Milan, they taught us that mathematics is the purest form of seduction.",
"E05ELIPAST_d052": "The teasing possibility of a solution, always just out of reach.",
"E05ELIPAST_d053": "Like now, when you're so close to understanding, but something's... distracting you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d054": "I'm just trying to learn calculus, [mo_r].",
"E05ELIPAST_d055": "Can we focus on the formulas? Please?",
"E05ELIPAST_d056": "Such dedication to your studies. How... admirable.",
"E05ELIPAST_d057": "Very well, let's be proper then. No more... practical demonstrations.",
"E05ELIPAST_d058": "Maybe the distraction is the point of this lesson?",
"E05ELIPAST_d059": "You're making it hard to remember why I even cared about derivatives.",
"E05ELIPAST_d060": "Clever boy. Understanding the subtext so quickly.",
"E05ELIPAST_d061": "Perhaps you're more like your [da_full_r_low] than I thought. Always seeing... opportunities.",
"E05ELIPAST_d062": "[mo_r]! The show was amazing? I saw the news and--",
"E05ELIPAST_d063": "Oh. You're helping [mc_name] with homework? Can I watch too?",
"E05ELIPAST_d064": "Amber, darling... past your bedtime.",
"E05ELIPAST_d065": "[mommy_r]'s giving your [br_full_r_low] a very special lesson right now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d066": "But I want to hear about—",
"E05ELIPAST_d067": "I just wanted to show you what they said about your dress on TV.",
"E05ELIPAST_d068": "Bed. Now. Your [br_full_r_low] needs... tutoring.",
"E05ELIPAST_d069": "The adults are talking, sweetheart. We'll discuss your little fashion opinions tomorrow.",
"E05ELIPAST_d070": "Fine...",
"E05ELIPAST_d071": "I just thought you'd want to know they loved you...",
"E05ELIPAST_d072": "That look on Amber's face. [mo_r] crushed her without even trying.",
"E05ELIPAST_d073": "[mo_r], that was harsh. She just wanted to share something with you.",
"E05ELIPAST_d074": "Amber looked really hurt just now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d075": "Oh please, she's being dramatic. She knows I need to focus on your education.",
"E05ELIPAST_d076": "When did you become so sensitive about your [si_full_r_low]'s feelings?",
"E05ELIPAST_d077": "Should we get back to these integrals? I still don't get them.",
"E05ELIPAST_d078": "Time's running out and I really need to pass this test.",
"E05ELIPAST_d079": "That's my boy. Always focused on what matters.",
"E05ELIPAST_d080": "Where was [mommy_r], sweetie? Oh right, limits... but maybe we'll just skip those tonight.",
"E05ELIPAST_d081": "You seem tense. Perhaps we need a change of venue.",
"E05ELIPAST_d082": "Perhaps tea would help us focus...",
"E05ELIPAST_d083": "Or something stronger? I have a bottle of that cognac you pretend not to steal sips from.",
"E05ELIPAST_d084": "Our little secret, hmm? Just like these special tutoring sessions.",
"E05ELIPAST_d085": "Your [da_full_r_low] never needs to know how... hands-on [mommy_r_low]'s teaching methods are.",
"E05ELIPAST_d086": "Tea... right...",
"E05ELIPAST_d087": "How the hell am I supposed to focus on calculus now?",
"E05ELIPAST_d088": "Your [da_full_r_low]'s always at that hospital...",
"E05ELIPAST_d089": "More concerned with his precious patients than his own [fm_r_low].",
"E05ELIPAST_d090": "He wouldn't notice if we burned the house down, would he, sweetheart?",
"E05ELIPAST_d091": "He works hard, [mo_r]. That's all.",
"E05ELIPAST_d092": "Whoa—!",
"E05ELIPAST_d093": "Shit! Of course I'd trip right now!",
"E05ELIPAST_d094": "Oh my, are you alright, darling?",
"E05ELIPAST_d095": "Always so clumsy around beauty, hmm?",
"E05ELIPAST_d096": "Or perhaps you just wanted a better view?",
"E05ELIPAST_d097": "Those modeling shoots in Bali left such awkward tan lines... right?",
"E05ELIPAST_d098": "I-- I'm just... tired. Long day.",
"E05ELIPAST_d099": "Don't look up. Don't look up. Don't—I'm looking up.",
"E05ELIPAST_d100": "I should probably—",
"E05ELIPAST_d101": "It's getting late, and I still have that test...",
"E05ELIPAST_d102": "Shall we review limits again, sweetie?",
"E05ELIPAST_d103": "I find them so... fascinating. The point where restraint meets--",
"E05ELIPAST_d104": "Uhm, sure... limits, right.",
"E05ELIPAST_d105": "Why does everything she says sound like she's talking about something else?",
"E05ELIPAST_d106": "You know, we can bend them just a bit...",
"E05ELIPAST_d107": "Mathematics is all about knowing when to push beyond conventional boundaries.",
"E05ELIPAST_d108": "Can you feel the tension in the equation, darling? How everything balances on a knife's edge?",
"E05ELIPAST_d109": "She's so close I can feel her heart beating. This is wrong. This is so wrong.",
"E05ELIPAST_d110": "[mo_r]!",
"E05ELIPAST_d111": "I—you—this isn't—",
"E05ELIPAST_d112": "Move back. Now. Before this gets worse!",
"E05ELIPAST_d113": "Wait!",
"E05ELIPAST_d114": "Oh!!",
"E05ELIPAST_d115": "Quick, help [mommy_r_low] out of this... Can't let it ruin the fabric.",
"E05ELIPAST_d116": "This dress cost more than your [da_full_r_low] earns in a week.",
"E05ELIPAST_d117": "The silk is imported from Milan, and it's completely ruined now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d118": "But...",
"E05ELIPAST_d119": "She can't be serious right now. Her dress is practically see-through!",
"E05ELIPAST_d120": "Shhh... just help [mommy_r_low]...",
"E05ELIPAST_d121": "Don't act so shocked. You've seen models changing backstage plenty of times.",
"E05ELIPAST_d122": "It's just skin, darling. Beautiful, expensive skin that your [da_full_r_low] pays fortunes to maintain.",
"E05ELIPAST_d123": "Oh god, why is she... like that?",
"E05ELIPAST_d124": "This isn't normal. This isn't what [mo_full_r_low]s do.",
"E05ELIPAST_d125": "We shouldn't...",
"E05ELIPAST_d126": "Shouldn't what? Accidents happen, darling. Anyways, I can't be like this all night...",
"E05ELIPAST_d127": "Besides, it's nothing you haven't seen in those magazines you hide under your mattress.",
"E05ELIPAST_d128": "Though I must say, [mommy_r_low]'s still got it better than those cheap girls, don't you think?",
"E05ELIPAST_d129": "This is wrong...",
"E05ELIPAST_d130": "I need to get out of here, now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d131": "You should cover up, [mo_r_low]!",
"E05ELIPAST_d132": "Anyone could walk in and see you like this!",
"E05ELIPAST_d133": "Maybe you're right... let's go to the bedroom.",
"E05ELIPAST_d134": "I have something special there. Something I've been saving for the right moment.",
"E05ELIPAST_d135": "Take my hand, sweetie. Let [mommy_r_low] show you something beautiful.",
"E05ELIPAST_d136": "This is La Perla's finest. Imported from Italy, just like me.",
"E05ELIPAST_d137": "The red is called 'Promessa passionale'. Appropriate, don't you think?",
"E05ELIPAST_d138": "They only made twelve of these in the world. I wore one just like it on the Milan runway last year.",
"E05ELIPAST_d139": "Your [da_full_r_low] never notices these details...",
"E05ELIPAST_d140": "Too busy cutting into people to appreciate real art when it's right in front of him.",
"E05ELIPAST_d141": "I shouldn't be seeing this. I shouldn't be here. Why can't I move?",
"E05ELIPAST_d142": "Let me show you a new thing... just don't tell [daddy_r_low], hmm?",
"E05ELIPAST_d143": "He wouldn't understand our special bond. How alike we truly are.",
"E05ELIPAST_d144": "I see how you look at me, sweetie. It's the same way all men look at me.",
"E05ELIPAST_d145": "But you're special. You're mine. My beautiful, brilliant boy.",
"E05ELIPAST_d146": "Just a little lesson, sweetie... You can use this example on the test tomorrow...",
"E05ELIPAST_d147": "Mathematics is about relationships between bodies, isn't it? The way they attract and repel.",
"E05ELIPAST_d148": "See, the limit gets closer and closer... just like this...",
"E05ELIPAST_d149": "Feel how the tension builds as we approach the boundary?",
"E05ELIPAST_d150": "This can't be happening. My own [mo_full_r_low] is—I can't even think it.",
"E05ELIPAST_d151": "[mo_r], stop! You're drunk...",
"E05ELIPAST_d152": "This isn't you. This is the champagne talking.",
"E05ELIPAST_d153": "Please let this be the alcohol. Please don't let this be who she really is.",
"E05ELIPAST_d154": "I can't... we can't... this is insane.",
"E05ELIPAST_d155": "I'm frozen. I can't even push her away. What's wrong with me?",
"E05ELIPAST_d156": "Don't fight it, darling. Some limits are meant to be crossed.",
"E05ELIPAST_d157": "Besides, who would ever know? Our sweet little secret...",
"E05ELIPAST_d158": "Get off me! This has gone far enough!",
"E05ELIPAST_d159": "[mo_r]? I had a nightmare...",
"E05ELIPAST_d160": "I saw monsters and they were—",
"E05ELIPAST_d161": "What... what are you doing?",
"E05ELIPAST_d162": "Why are you on top of [mc_name] like that?",
"E05ELIPAST_d163": "You need help, [mo_r]. This isn't normal!",
"E05ELIPAST_d164": "How dare you reject me! After everything I've done for you!",
"E05ELIPAST_d165": "Amber! Thank god you're here. [mo_r]'s not feeling well.",
"E05ELIPAST_d166": "She had too much to drink at her party and fell. I was just helping her up.",
"E05ELIPAST_d167": "Is [mommy_r] sick? Should I get [daddy_r] from the hospital?",
"E05ELIPAST_d168": "Your face is all red, [mc_name]. Are you getting sick too?",
"E05ELIPAST_d169": "Nobody's calling anybody. Especially not your [da_full_r_low].",
"E05ELIPAST_d170": "Go back to bed!",
"E05ELIPAST_d171": "This doesn't concern you, you stupid little girl!",
"E05ELIPAST_d172": "But...",
"E05ELIPAST_d173": "You're hurting [mc_name]. I can see it in his face.",
"E05ELIPAST_d174": "Amber, please just go. You shouldn't see this.",
"E05ELIPAST_d175": "Everything's fine, [sis_r_low]. [mo_r] just needs some rest.",
"E05ELIPAST_d176": "How about I check under your bed for monsters? Would that help?",
"E05ELIPAST_d177": "Would you? The shadows were moving again and making scary shapes.",
"E05ELIPAST_d178": "You're the bravest, [mc_name]. You're not afraid of anything.",
"E05ELIPAST_d179": "If only you knew how terrified I am right now.",
"E05ELIPAST_d180": "Bed, now Amber.",
"E05ELIPAST_d181": "I won't ask again.",
"E05ELIPAST_d182": "Or I'll give you something to have nightmares about.",
"E05ELIPAST_d183": "The look in [mo_r]'s eyes... I've never seen her like this. It's like she's possessed.",
"E05ELIPAST_d184": "Okay... I'm sorry...",
"E05ELIPAST_d185": "Let's go check your room right now, okay? I'll stay until you fall asleep.",
"E05ELIPAST_d186": "I'll even tell you that story about the brave fox you like so much.",
"E05ELIPAST_d187": "The one where she outsmarts the snake? That's my favorite!",
"E05ELIPAST_d188": "Can we use flashlights under the blanket like a tent again?",
"E05ELIPAST_d189": "Anything to get away from this nightmare.",
"E05ELIPAST_d190": "I-- I better just go... study alone...",
"E05ELIPAST_d191": "This... whatever this is... it needs to stop. Please.",
"E05ELIPAST_d192": "Go, study... alone.",
"E05ELIPAST_d193": "Ungrateful boy. Just like your [da_full_r_low].",
"E05ELIPAST_d194": "I've never been so relieved to escape a room in my life.",
"E05ELIPAST_d195": "I'm sorry, [mo_r]. This was... I don't even know what this was.",
"E05ELIPAST_d196": "But it can never happen again. Never.",
"E05ELIPAST_d197": "Don't you dare judge me. You wanted it too. I saw it in your eyes.",
"E05ELIPAST_d198": "Go play hero for your [si_full_r_low]. It's what you do best, isn't it?",
"E05ELIPAST_d199": "I need to protect Amber from... whatever [mo_r] is becoming.",
"E05ELIPAST_d200": "Tonight...I didn't want to be a [mo_r], I just wanted to be Elizabeth.",
"E05ELIPAST_d201": "The Elizabeth who commands runways. The one men fight over backstage.",
"E05ELIPAST_d202": "Not this shadow of myself, trapped between [chi_r] who needs me and a husband who doesn't see me.",
"E05ELIPAST_d203": "Is it so wrong to want to feel that power again? Before it all slips away?",
"E05ELIPAST_d204": "They never understand what I sacrifice for them.",
"E05ELIPAST_d205": "My career is at its peak, and what does Michael do? Works all night.",
"E05ELIPAST_d206": "Men like the idea of a beautiful wife until she demands the attention she deserves.",
"E05ELIPAST_d207": "Then they hide behind their work, their ethics... or run to younger women.",

"E05ELISHOW_d001": "Where's she? ... Bathroom?",
"E05ELISHOW_d002": "One minute we were talking, the next she just... disappeared.",
"E05ELISHOW_d003": "These memory flashes are coming back. Why? I can't tell what's now and what's then anymore.",
"E05ELISHOW_d004": "The shower?",
"E05ELISHOW_d005": "I don't think she's in any state to take a shower. She'll just flood the room.",
"E05ELISHOW_d006": "With all those pills in her system, she could slip, hit her head...",
"E05ELISHOW_d007": "The last thing I need is to find her passed out in a puddle of water.",
"E05ELISHOW_d008": "Damn, when did I become the parent in this relationship?",
"E05ELISHOW_d009": "Maybe I should check on her. Make sure she's okay.",
"E05ELISHOW_d010": "[mo_r]? You there?",
"E05ELISHOW_d011": "I just want to make sure you're alright.",
"E05ELISHOW_d012": "This feels oddly familiar.",
"E05ELISHOW_d013": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}I was searching for the ocean beyond your shoulder...",
"E05ELISHOW_d014": "What's she doing?",
"E05ELISHOW_d015": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}In the corner of a landscape blurring with tears...",
"E05ELISHOW_d016": "Singing?",
"E05ELISHOW_d017": "That old Akina Nakamori song she used to sing when I was a kid.",
"E05ELISHOW_d018": "She's completely out of it. Those pills mixed with whatever she drank...",
"E05ELISHOW_d019": "I should get her out of there before she hurts herself.",
"E05ELISHOW_d020": "Is this another manipulation? Another way to pull me into her web?",
"E05ELISHOW_d021": "Thirty years of modeling taught her how to make anything look natural.",
"E05ELISHOW_d022": "Fuck... even at her age, her body's still incredible.",
"E05ELISHOW_d023": "Those long legs, that ass that's still firm despite the years...",
"E05ELISHOW_d024": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor} That shore scattered with our memories...",
"E05ELISHOW_d025": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}I want to turn it into a small green stone and keep it in my heart...",
"E05ELISHOW_d026": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}Between repeating dawns and dusks...",
"E05ELISHOW_d027": "I've got a bad feeling...",
"E05ELISHOW_d028": "She's not even aware I'm here.",
"E05ELISHOW_d029": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}We depart from the season of goodbyes...",
"E05ELISHOW_d030": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}Leaving a fragment of emerald in each other's hearts...",
"E05ELISHOW_d031": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}If you close your eyes, kiss my eyelids...",

"E05ELISHOW_d037": "{outlinecolor=#ffffff00}🎶{/outlinecolor}Because I hold a fragment of emerald against my heart...",
"E05ELISHOW_d038": "I should have never left Milan... never married a man who can't see beauty decay...",
"E05ELISHOW_d039": "Thirty years of my life... wasted...",
"E05ELISHOW_d040": "My body betrays me... inside and out...",
"E05ELISHOW_d041": "I've never seen her this vulnerable before.",
"E05ELISHOW_d042": "She's always been obsessed with her image, even at home. This is... disturbing.",
"E05ELISHOW_d043": "No wonder she takes so many pills. Reality must be unbearable for her.",
"E05ELISHOW_d044": "Sweetie... how long have... have you been watching?",
"E05ELISHOW_d045": "Your [mo_full_r_low] is a mess, isn't she? Not the woman you remember.",
"E05ELISHOW_d046": "You shouldn't see [mo_r] like this, so pathetic... so old...",
"E05ELISHOW_d047": "God, these sagging breasts, these stretch marks... this wasted body.",
"E05ELISHOW_d048": "[mo_r], no. You're beautiful. Always have been. You're just not well.",
"E05ELISHOW_d049": "The pills, the drinking—they're making everything worse.",
"E05ELISHOW_d050": "Let me help you. Please.",
"E05ELISHOW_d051": "I don't deserve a [so_r_low] like you. So... so good to me. And what am... what do... what have...",
"E05ELISHOW_d052": "Why am... am I such a failure? A drunk... a junkie...",
"E05ELISHOW_d053": "Let me help you get to bed.",
"E05ELISHOW_d054": "You're going to catch cold standing there like this.",
"E05ELISHOW_d055": "Remember when you'd help me prepare for tests? How patient you were?",
"E05ELISHOW_d056": "You'd stay up all night if that's what it took. No matter how tired you were.",
"E05ELISHOW_d057": "That woman is still in there somewhere. The one who cared so much.",
"E05ELISHOW_d058": "Life hasn't been easy for either of us, has it?",
"E05ELISHOW_d059": "But we're still here. We're still standing. That has to count for something.",
"E05ELISHOW_d060": "Let's just get you to bed before you catch cold.",
"E05ELISHOW_d061": "Remember how you used to come to my room in that silk nightgown?",
"E05ELISHOW_d062": "The way it clung to your body... how you'd let it slip off your shoulder...",
"E05ELISHOW_d063": "How your hand would always find its way under the covers...",
"E05ELISHOW_d064": "Remember when you'd help me prepare for shoots?",
"E05ELISHOW_d065": "You had such an eye for what worked. Which outfits would photograph best.",
"E05ELISHOW_d066": "You knew my body better than anyone... every angle, every curve...",
"E05ELISHOW_d067": "Of course, [mo_r]. We made a great team, didn't we?",
"E05ELISHOW_d068": "You always looked perfect. Every magazine cover, every runway.",
"E05ELISHOW_d069": "Yes, yes. You were so helpful... and... and kind.",
"E05ELISHOW_d070": "Even when the other boys your age were out playing, you stayed with [mommy_r_low].",
"E05ELISHOW_d071": "My perfect little man. The only one who ever truly saw me.",
"E05ELISHOW_d072": "I'm tired...",
"E05ELISHOW_d073": "...of pretending everything is okay. It isn't... it hasn't been...",

"E05ELISHOW_d075": "My beauty, my sanity, my purpose... what am I without them?",
"E05ELISHOW_d076": "Please... just hold me...",
"E05ELISHOW_d077": "Make me feel beautiful again. Like when you were younger and looked at me that way.",
"E05ELISHOW_d078": "...please...",
"E05ELISHOW_d079": "Just for tonight. Just for now. Before I disappear completely.",
"E05ELISHOW_d080": "I need to feel something... anything besides... this...",
"E05ELISHOW_d081": "Feel like a woman again... not just a decoration in this house...",
"E05ELISHOW_d082": "Your touch... always made me feel so alive... so wanted...",
"E05ELISHOW_d083": "Look at us...",
"E05ELISHOW_d084": "Do anyone still want me? Even like this? Even with these wrinkles, these sagging breasts?",
"E05ELISHOW_d085": "I'm... disgusting... an old woman... a monster...",
"E05ELISHOW_d086": "Your hands feel so good... so different from him...",
"E05ELISHOW_d087": "No one has to know... our little secret... like before... right?",
"E05ELISHOW_d088": "I need to feel something... anything besides... this...",
"E05ELISHOW_d089": "Some mornings I wake up and don't recognize myself in the mirror.",
"E05ELISHOW_d090": "Where did she go? That woman everyone wanted? That woman you adored?",
"E05ELISHOW_d091": "Look at us...",
"E05ELISHOW_d092": "Time is so cruel, isn't it? Especially to women like me.",
"E05ELISHOW_d093": "I'm... disgusting... an old woman... a monster...",
"E05ELISHOW_d094": "I turned down Paris for this life. My last chance at the big time.",
"E05ELISHOW_d095": "Now I'm just Michael's aging wife. The European Rose, wilted.",
"E05ELISHOW_d096": "[mo_r], look at me.",
"E05ELISHOW_d097": "You need to stop this. You're hurting yourself.",
"E05ELISHOW_d098": "You are the most beautiful woman in the world. No mirror will tell otherwise.",
"E05ELISHOW_d099": "Let me help you get dressed and back to bed.",
"E05ELISHOW_d100": "No... get out! GET OUT!",
"E05ELISHOW_d101": "Don't look at me like that! With pity! I don't need your fucking pity!",
"E05ELISHOW_d102": "You're just like him! Pretending to care while judging every flaw!",
"E05ELISHOW_d103": "GET OUT! NOW! LEAVE ME ALONE!",
"E05ELISHOW_d104": "Fuck. I handled that all wrong.",
"E05ELISHOW_d105": "She's too far gone right now. Too many pills, too much alcohol, too much self-loathing.",
"E05ELISHOW_d106": "I'll check on her when she sobers up. If she even remembers any of this.",

"E05PZSMS_d001": "Elizabeth's breakdown was worse than I expected. She needs professional help, not more pills.",
"E05PZSMS_d002": "I need to clear my head. Focus on something I can actually solve.",
"E05PZSMS_d003": "That attack on Paz in my apartment... I should check how she's doing.",
"E05PZSMS_d004": "At least with Paz, I know where I stand. Unlike this twisted [fm_r_low] dynamic.",
"E05PZSMS_d005": "I'm just gonna make sure everything is all right.",
"E05PZSMS_d006": "She took a beating because of me. Because she was looking into things I asked her to.",
"E05PZSMS_d007": "While I've been dealing with Elizabeth's drama, Paz has been putting herself in real danger.",
"E05PZSMS_d008": "What if that masked woman comes back for her? What if she's hurt worse than she let on?",
"E05PZSMS_d009": "I couldn't protect Elizabeth from herself. Maybe I can at least help Paz.",
"E05PZSMS_d010": "After everything we've been through in Osaka, I owe her that much.",

"E05PZSMSS_d001": "Hey... u ok after that attack?",
"E05PZSMSS_d002": "Hey, yea I'm fine. Nothing serious {outlinecolor=#ffffff00}👍{/outlinecolor}",

"E05PZVC_d002": "Thought I'd never cave, but turns out flip phones aren't cutting it anymore.",
"E05PZVC_d003": "Don't judge the mess. Been busy with this... situation.",
"E05PZVC_d004": "So, about those pictures from my apartment—did you manage to recover them?",
"E05PZVC_d005": "Damn, she doesn't even realize how she's sitting. Same old Paz, zero self-awareness.",
"E05PZVC_d006": "Yes. One moment...",
"E05PZVC_d007": "Gotta find it in this disaster of a gallery... there.",
"E05PZVC_d008": "Check this out.",
"E05PZVC_d009": "{a=show:picview_ep05_sms03}{image=thumb_ep05_sms03}",
"E05PZVC_d010": "That's some occult shit, isn't it?",
"E05PZVC_d011": "Freaky as hell. Found it exactly like this when I got there.",
"E05PZVC_d012": "Does it mean anything to you? I mean that's what that woman said, that everything was for you.",
"E05PZVC_d013": "Fox-mask lady had your name, knew your apartment. Creepy stuff.",
"E05PZVC_d014": "Not your typical break-in, that's for sure.",
"E05PZVC_d015": "I don't know, I'm gonna check what I can find about it.",
"E05PZVC_d016": "What the hell have I gotten her into?",
"E05PZVC_d017": "Do you think it's related to the Tanaka case?",
"E05PZVC_d018": "The Kobe Yagamaguchi-gumi?",
"E05PZVC_d019": "Maybe... I mean the case got closed pretty abruptly... like they didn't want us to keep investigating it.",
"E05PZVC_d020": "Just when we were getting somewhere, poof—gone.",
"E05PZVC_d021": "You get promoted even when you were so deep in that case and suddenly all the evidence goes away.",
"E05PZVC_d022": "Convenient timing, don't you think? You're out, case closed, everyone moves on.",
"E05PZVC_d023": "Except now we've got fox-mask lady leaving you presents.",
"E05PZVC_d024": "Well I can't argue about that...",
"E05PZVC_d025": "She's pissed. That spark in her eyes is the same one from the Takahashi raid. Nothing good follows that look.",
"E05PZVC_d026": "I know I'm not like you. You're like a genius and all, but don't you find that suspicious?",
"E05PZVC_d027": "You of all people. The guy who sees patterns in everything.",
"E05PZVC_d028": "Ever since you left, stuff's been weird at the precinct.",
"E05PZVC_d029": "I don't know... what are you trying to say, Paz?",
"E05PZVC_d030": "That someone's covering tracks?",
"E05PZVC_d031": "I've been checking all these stuff...",
"E05PZVC_d032": "Been digging through what's left of your case files. Most of it's gone or redacted.",
"E05PZVC_d033": "Sorry for unprofessional look but I've been here since 5 AM.",
"E05PZVC_d034": "Haven't exactly been prioritizing dress code lately.",
"E05PZVC_d035": "So, there's no trace left in the system. Like someone deleted them.",
"E05PZVC_d036": "Pictures, reports, witness statements—poof. Digital trail's cold.",
"E05PZVC_d037": "Someone's got access who shouldn't.",
"E05PZVC_d038": "Are you suggesting a conspiracy or we have a mole or something?",
"E05PZVC_d039": "Maybe. Don't you think it's all a bit... convenient? Like, too perfect?",
"E05PZVC_d040": "Our rookies couldn't delete lunch orders without leaving traces.",
"E05PZVC_d041": "So, let me guess, what do you propose to do, then?",
"E05PZVC_d042": "She's already made up her mind. That determined look hasn't changed since academy days.",
"E05PZVC_d043": "We can investigate together. On our own.",
"E05PZVC_d044": "Like we did with the smuggling ring. Just you and me, off the books.",
"E05PZVC_d045": "Before things went to shit.",
"E05PZVC_d046": "Paz, I wish I could help, but honestly, what can we do right now?",
"E05PZVC_d047": "I'm still injured and fucked up in Tokyo and you're still a field officer in Osaka, right?",
"E05PZVC_d048": "Can't exactly hop on a train with this leg.",
"E05PZVC_d049": "So you say I can't investigate because I'm not a detective like you?",
"E05PZVC_d050": "After all the crap we went through? That's how it is now?",
"E05PZVC_d051": "Rank finally went to your head, [mc_name]?",
"E05PZVC_d052": "It's not about that. I didn't even want a promotion in the first place.",
"E05PZVC_d053": "But the fact remains that you can't access some stuff.",
"E05PZVC_d054": "Also, how could we do that from 500 kilometers away? You know that's not going to work, right?",
"E05PZVC_d055": "This isn't about badges or rank.",
"E05PZVC_d056": "Besides that, what if something like the incident from that night happens to you again? What will happen then?",
"E05PZVC_d057": "I'm not there to have your back this time.",
"E05PZVC_d058": "Well, we could start with the info we got from the apartment, like that picture. It's a start, right?",
"E05PZVC_d059": "I'm already in it. Fox-mask lady made sure of that.",
"E05PZVC_d060": "And don't worry about me. If anything like that ever happened to me again, well... let's say that I would make sure to be prepared this time.",
"E05PZVC_d061": "Got my piece under the pillow now. Won't catch me sleeping again.",
"E05PZVC_d062": "You should rest, you still on night shift?",
"E05PZVC_d063": "She hasn't changed a bit. Still charging ahead, consequences be damned.",
"E05PZVC_d064": "Can't sleep lately. Remember our late shifts? When you'd bring coffee at 3 AM?",
"E05PZVC_d065": "That god-awful vending machine sludge you called coffee.",
"E05PZVC_d066": "Kinda miss it, actually. Quiet nights, bad coffee, good company.",
"E05PZVC_d067": "Worst coffee in Osaka, yeah. But your company made it taste good.",
"E05PZVC_d068": "Never did find coffee that bad in Tokyo. It's a special Osaka talent.",
"E05PZVC_d069": "Miss that. Miss working with you.",
"E05PZVC_d070": "Place isn't the same without your brooding ass around.",
"E05PZVC_d071": "Oh! Almost forgot.",
"E05PZVC_d072": "Check this too",
"E05PZVC_d073": "{a=show:picview_ep05_sms04}{image=thumb_ep05_sms04}",
"E05PZVC_d074": "Found it around all those bells.",
"E05PZVC_d075": "Looks familiar?",
"E05PZVC_d076": "A key?",
"E05PZVC_d077": "That key... reminds me of something, but I can't place it.",
"E05PZVC_d078": "That's the key of the ritual circle found on your apartment.",
"E05PZVC_d079": "Center of the whole thing. Like it was some kind of focal point.",
"E05PZVC_d080": "Do you have it?",
"E05PZVC_d081": "I need to get a closer look at it.",
"E05PZVC_d082": "Sadly I don't. It's in evidence storage at the PD.",
"E05PZVC_d083": "Standard procedure. Logged and bagged.",
"E05PZVC_d084": "Evidence locker 3, if you're curious.",
"E05PZVC_d085": "Do you think I should take a trip there and retrieve it, what you say?",
"E05PZVC_d086": "Wouldn't be hard. Night shift's usually just Takeda, and he sleeps half the time.",
"E05PZVC_d087": "In and out, ten minutes tops.",
"E05PZVC_d088": "What? Stealing from an Osaka PD evidence locker?",
"E05PZVC_d089": "You can't be serious... that's career suicide!",
"E05PZVC_d090": "They catch you, that's it. No second chances.",
"E05PZVC_d091": "Well... you already have seen what happens to anything that has a link with the Kobe Yagamaguchi-gumi, haven't you?",
"E05PZVC_d092": "How long before this key disappears too? A day? A week?",
"E05PZVC_d093": "You know I'm right. We're running out of time.",
"E05PZVC_d094": "I don't know... I can't push you to do that...",
"E05PZVC_d095": "It's your career on the line, not mine.",
"E05PZVC_d096": "Don't talk about pushing, lol, I haven't forgotten you pushed me from the car that night",
"E05PZVC_d097": "Saved my ass then. Maybe it's my turn to return the favor.",
"E05PZVC_d098": "Well, it's up to you. I'm already deep in this.",
"E05PZVC_d099": "Say the word, partner. Just like old times.",
"E05PZVC_d100": "You really don't have to do it.",
"E05PZVC_d101": "But... yeah. Go for it. And be careful. Please. No risks.",
"E05PZVC_d102": "First sign of trouble, you bail. Promise me that.",
"E05PZVC_d103": "No, Paz. We do this by the book. Request the evidence properly.",
"E05PZVC_d104": "I'm not letting you throw away your badge for this.",
"E05PZVC_d105": "We'll find another way. We always do.",
"E05PZVC_d106": "Yes, sir!",
"E05PZVC_d107": "Look at you, all worried. It's cute.",
"E05PZVC_d108": "Let me know when it's safe for you to head over.",
"E05PZVC_d109": "I'm going right now!",
"E05PZVC_d110": "By the book? Seriously? After everything we've seen?",
"E05PZVC_d111": "You know that key won't be there in 24 hours.",
"E05PZVC_d112": "But fine. Your call, [mc_name]. Hope you know what you're doing.",
"E05PZVC_d113": "Wait, NOW? Like, literally? Are you crazy?!",
"E05PZVC_d114": "God, Paz, at least wait till morning!",
"E05PZVC_d115": "You don't become a detective by being careful all the time, do you, [mc_name]?",
"E05PZVC_d116": "Night's the perfect time. Fewer eyes.",
"E05PZVC_d117": "I know you're frustrated. I am too. But we can't stoop to their level.",
"E05PZVC_d118": "If we break the rules, we're no better than them.",
"E05PZVC_d119": "Rules. Right. Because they've worked so well for us.",
"E05PZVC_d120": "Wake up, [mc_name]. The game is rigged.",
"E05PZVC_d121": "I don't like the idea, but okay...",
"E05PZVC_d122": "Just let me know when it's over, and stay safe, okay?",
"E05PZVC_d123": "And Paz? Thanks. I mean it.",
"E05PZVC_d124": "Just give me time to figure something out from this end.",
"E05PZVC_d125": "We'll get that key, but the right way.",
"E05PZVC_d126": "Time. The one thing we don't have. But whatever.",
"E05PZVC_d127": "Don't worry, [mc_name]. You can always count on me.",
"E05PZVC_d128": "Like old times, right? Me doing the legwork, you overthinking everything.",
"E05PZVC_d129": "See ya later.",
"E05PZVC_d130": "See ya, Paz. Be careful out there.",
"E05PZVC_d131": "Twenty-four hours. That's all you get.",
"E05PZVC_d132": "After that, I'm doing it my way, partner or not.",
"E05PZVC_d133": "Don't let me down, [mc_name].",
"E05PZVC_d134": "I won't. I promise.",

"E05NMBATH_d001": "That call with Paz has my head spinning. Rituals, fox masks, evidence theft...",
"E05NMBATH_d002": "I need to clear my mind.",
"E05NMBATH_d003": "After what I saw by the pool this morning, I should check on Nanami... just in case!",
"E05NMBATH_d004": "Searching for something, [da_full_r]?",
"E05NMBATH_d005": "Or should I say... someone? You look like you're on a mission.",
"E05NMBATH_d006": "Madison and Nanami. Seen them?",
"E05NMBATH_d007": "They were supposed to be doing yoga or something.",
"E05NMBATH_d008": "Your real [dau_r_low] is right here.",
"E05NMBATH_d009": "Yes, yes, Commander White, don't be jealous now.",
"E05NMBATH_d010": "I just want to make sure Nanami is okay. Madison can be... intense.",
"E05NMBATH_d011": "They're not in this bathroom.",
"E05NMBATH_d012": "Wait! I know where they are... follow me.",
"E05NMBATH_d013": "Madison has a special spot for her 'private lessons' with Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d014": "I've seen them disappear there before. Madison thinks she's so sneaky.",
"E05NMBATH_d015": "Ok.",
"E05NMBATH_d016": "Lead the way, Commander.",
"E05NMBATH_d017": "Now we just need to head left this way, and we'll find a new spot you haven't seen yet.",
"E05NMBATH_d018": "What the fuck?! Another room?",
"E05NMBATH_d019": "How many secret spaces does this house have?",
"E05NMBATH_d020": "Just when I think I know this place, something new appears.",
"E05NMBATH_d021": "They probably went to take a bath together... like they do most times...",
"E05NMBATH_d022": "Madison says it's 'traditional Japanese bonding' or whatever.",
"E05NMBATH_d023": "She's been doing it since they became friends.",
"E05NMBATH_d024": "Most times?!!",
"E05NMBATH_d025": "And nobody thought this was weird?",
"E05NMBATH_d026": "Yeah... like.. every time that Nanami is around...",
"E05NMBATH_d027": "Madison's very... protective of their friendship.",
"E05NMBATH_d028": "Gets super jealous if anyone else spends time with Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d029": "Wow...",
"E05NMBATH_d030": "That explains a lot about how she reacted when I talked to Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d031": "What exactly is Madison doing here?",
"E05NMBATH_d032": "Anyway, I'm off to the cosplay contest! I don't know why you wanted to check on them, but here it is, just in case.",
"E05NMBATH_d033": "Be careful though. Madison will flip if she catches you spying.",
"E05NMBATH_d034": "Just don't say or think anything that might upset me...",
"E05NMBATH_d035": "You know how I feel about you paying attention to other girls.",
"E05NMBATH_d036": "Yes, ma'am, Commander White, ma'am.",
"E05NMBATH_d037": "Go win that contest. Show them what a real cosplayer looks like.",
"E05NMBATH_d038": "Don't mock me, [da_r_low]!",
"E05NMBATH_d039": "I worked hard on this costume. I'm going to crush the competition.",
"E05NMBATH_d040": "Unlike some people, I actually finish what I start.",
"E05NMBATH_d041": "The garden greenhouse... converted to a Japanese bath? Elizabeth's extravagance knows no bounds.",
"E05NMBATH_d042": "Beautiful place though. Almost peaceful, if it weren't for what's happening in there.",
"E05NMBATH_d043": "I can hear voices... That's definitely Nanami and Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d044": "What are you looking at?",
"E05NMBATH_d045": "Spying again, [br_full_r_low]? Becoming quite the habit.",
"E05NMBATH_d046": "First by the pool, now here. Developing a taste for voyeurism?",
"E05NMBATH_d047": "Just passing by. Didn't know anyone was here.",
"E05NMBATH_d048": "Thought you'd left.",
"E05NMBATH_d049": "Yeah, but.. uhm.. just checking up on things.",
"E05NMBATH_d050": "Making sure everything's okay after this morning.",
"E05NMBATH_d051": "Of course you are.",
"E05NMBATH_d052": "Always so concerned. Such a protective big [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d053": "Though I notice you're more protective of some than others.",
"E05NMBATH_d054": "Woah... Almost caught me checking on them!",
"E05NMBATH_d055": "Madison's eyes... that wasn't just annoyance. That was pure possessive rage.",
"E05NMBATH_d056": "Maybe I should back off. But something about this feels wrong.",
"E05NMBATH_d057": "Is she going to get back? Maybe she is going to change clothes or something...",
"E05NMBATH_d058": "I mean, Nanami is alone now... I can ask her how she's doing...",
"E05NMBATH_d059": "But if Madison catches me talking to her again...",
"E05NMBATH_d060": "Just need to check if she's okay...",
"E05NMBATH_d061": "If Madison's doing something to her... I can't just stand by.",
"E05NMBATH_d062": "And if Nanami's uncomfortable, she might not know how to speak up.",
"E05NMBATH_d063": "Really, [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05NMBATH_d064": "Another man thinking he has the right to invade a woman's space.",
"E05NMBATH_d065": "Did [daddy_r_low] teach you to be a peeping tom, or is that natural male instinct?",
"E05NMBATH_d066": "I was just—",
"E05NMBATH_d067": "Making sure Nanami isn't being manipulated.",
"E05NMBATH_d068": "Manipulated? Please.",
"E05NMBATH_d069": "You're exactly like [da_full_r]. Pretending nobility while satisfying your disgusting urges.",
"E05NMBATH_d070": "Men never protect women. They just pick which predator gets first access.",
"E05NMBATH_d071": "That's why I protect her from men like you--",
"E05NMBATH_d072": "From men, period. The world's greatest disease.",
"E05NMBATH_d073": "Don't make me tell her what you tried to do.",
"E05NMBATH_d074": "I'd hate to shatter her pure image of her precious [mc_name].",
"E05NMBATH_d075": "Though maybe seeing your true nature would be the best lesson...",
"E05NMBATH_d076": "Maybe I should just go...",
"E05NMBATH_d077": "Madison's hatred runs deeper than I thought. Has she always seen me this way?",
"E05NMBATH_d078": "Maddie! Y-you're back!",
"E05NMBATH_d079": "Sorry for the interruption, sweet one. Just chasing off a pest.",
"E05NMBATH_d080": "Was someone there? I thought I heard voices...",
"E05NMBATH_d081": "Nobody important. Just my disgusting [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d082": "[mc_name]? But he's not—",
"E05NMBATH_d083": "Let me tell you what men really think about girls like us, Nanami...",
"E05NMBATH_d084": "Still lurking around, [br_full_r_low]? Can't find anything better to do?",
"E05NMBATH_d085": "Just making sure everyone's alright.",
"E05NMBATH_d086": "How noble. Always the [fm_r_low] protector.",
"E05NMBATH_d087": "She's gone back inside. What now?",
"E05NMBATH_d088": "Nanami's alone with her again.",
"E05NMBATH_d089": "Something about their 'friendship' doesn't sit right.",
"E05NMBATH_d090": "I'll just observe from here. Need to see what Madison's really up to.",
"E05NMBATH_d091": "Here, I brought some water from inside.",
"E05NMBATH_d092": "Thank you, Maddie.",
"E05NMBATH_d093": "Of course, sweetie. I always take care of what's mine.",
"E05NMBATH_d094": "Ehm, Maddie. I am thirsty too...",
"E05NMBATH_d095": "Could I have some?",
"E05NMBATH_d096": "I know a special way we can share.",
"E05NMBATH_d097": "Mmph!!",
"E05NMBATH_d098": "Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!!",
"E05NMBATH_d099": "Did she just—? With Nanami?",
"E05NMBATH_d100": "So? Did you like that?",
"E05NMBATH_d101": "First time sharing like girls do? Like women do?",
"E05NMBATH_d102": "I-- I didn't expect that at all...",
"E05NMBATH_d103": "You're just too cute, Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d104": "Thank you, Maddie...",
"E05NMBATH_d105": "But wasn't that a kiss?",
"E05NMBATH_d106": "No... That was just sharing water.",
"E05NMBATH_d107": "Don't overthink it.",
"E05NMBATH_d108": "Eh?",
"E05NMBATH_d109": "But your lips...",
"E05NMBATH_d110": "Kissing is more like this.",
"E05NMBATH_d111": "Let me show you what real women do together.",
"E05NMBATH_d112": "What we can share that men can never understand.",
"E05NMBATH_d113": "Fuck! She's completely manipulating her.",
"E05NMBATH_d114": "Using Nanami's insecurity and need for acceptance.",
"E05NMBATH_d115": "Feel the difference?",
"E05NMBATH_d116": "How it makes your heart race?",
"E05NMBATH_d117": "Yeah... but...",
"E05NMBATH_d118": "Isn't this wrong? We're both girls...",
"E05NMBATH_d119": "I don't mind teaching you more, just if you want to.",
"E05NMBATH_d120": "Men made those rules to control us.",
"E05NMBATH_d121": "It's not like we are girlfriends or anything like that.",
"E05NMBATH_d122": "We are just friends that teach things to each other...",
"E05NMBATH_d123": "Special, pure friends. Without men's corruption.",
"E05NMBATH_d124": "Ehm... I just think we shouldn't do that kind of thing...",
"E05NMBATH_d125": "My [mo_full_r_low] would be upset...",
"E05NMBATH_d126": "Oh? Why not?",
"E05NMBATH_d127": "Do you think I'm disgusting now?",
"E05NMBATH_d128": "Am I the only one who wants to be special friends?",
"E05NMBATH_d129": "Everyone always leaves me. Even you now...",
"E05NMBATH_d130": "Maybe I should just disappear...",
"E05NMBATH_d131": "No! Please don't cry!",
"E05NMBATH_d132": "Don't say things like that, Maddie!",
"E05NMBATH_d133": "You hate me now...",
"E05NMBATH_d134": "Everyone does. I'm too broken to love.",
"E05NMBATH_d135": "Never! You're my best friend!",
"E05NMBATH_d136": "I could never hate you! Never!",
"E05NMBATH_d137": "Do you really mean it?",
"E05NMBATH_d138": "You won't abandon me like everyone else?",
"E05NMBATH_d139": "Yeah!",
"E05NMBATH_d140": "You saved me when I was alone. I'd never leave you.",
"E05NMBATH_d141": "Then let's have lots of fun!",
"E05NMBATH_d142": "I'm so happy.",
"E05NMBATH_d143": "Just us girls. No men to ruin our purity.",
"E05NMBATH_d144": "Me too.",
"E05NMBATH_d145": "As long as we're just friends...",
"E05NMBATH_d146": "So this is what Isabella meant about Madison and Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d147": "Amber warned me about this side of Madison. Should've listened.",
"E05NMBATH_d148": "They have no idea I'm watching. I should go, but...",
"E05NMBATH_d149": "What Madison's doing doesn't seem right. Nanami looks uncomfortable.",
"E05NMBATH_d150": "Relax, Nanami-chan. Your muscles are so tense.",
"E05NMBATH_d151": "A proper bath is about more than just getting clean.",
"E05NMBATH_d152": "M-Maddie... this feels different from last time...",
"E05NMBATH_d153": "What happend? Don't you wanna take a bath together? Are we not friends anymore?",
"E05NMBATH_d154": "After everything I've done for you? All those times I protected you?",
"E05NMBATH_d155": "Ah! No, it's not that!",
"E05NMBATH_d156": "I'm just embarrassed, that's all!",
"E05NMBATH_d157": "It's just... your hands are...",
"E05NMBATH_d158": "Wow, Nanami. Your body is really beautiful!",
"E05NMBATH_d159": "So soft, so pure.",
"E05NMBATH_d160": "You don't need to be shy around me. We are just girls bathing together...",
"E05NMBATH_d161": "I-I know, but my [mo_full_r_low] always said touching like this is...",
"E05NMBATH_d162": "Now, let's continue having fun!",
"E05NMBATH_d163": "Your [mo_full_r_low]'s ideas are so old-fashioned. This is how modern girls bond.",
"E05NMBATH_d164": "Eh... That tickles a little bit... aah...",
"E05NMBATH_d165": "Should we be doing this, Maddie?",
"E05NMBATH_d166": "Let's wash this area next, okay?",
"E05NMBATH_d167": "Every part needs proper attention, Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d168": "That... That's... My...",
"E05NMBATH_d169": "Maddie, I don't think we should—",
"E05NMBATH_d170": "Hmm? What's wrong? Is this place dirty too?",
"E05NMBATH_d171": "Don't worry, I know exactly how to clean it properly.",
"E05NMBATH_d172": "Trust me, Nanami. I'd never hurt you like a man would.",
"E05NMBATH_d173": "Aaah... Nnngg... Mmm...",
"E05NMBATH_d174": "This isn't—I've never—",
"E05NMBATH_d175": "Your face is so cute when you're like this.",
"E05NMBATH_d176": "Ehh... Aah...",
"E05NMBATH_d177": "See how special our friendship is? This is what I was talking about.",
"E05NMBATH_d178": "I can't... I'm feeling...",
"E05NMBATH_d179": "Men could never understand this connection.",
"E05NMBATH_d180": "Aaaaah!!",
"E05NMBATH_d181": "See? It wasn't bad at all, don't ya think?",
"E05NMBATH_d182": "Friends help friends get clean...",
"E05NMBATH_d183": "And now you're truly clean, inside and out.",
"E05NMBATH_d184": "Maddie... I feel strange...",
"E05NMBATH_d185": "Shhh... It's okay.",
"E05NMBATH_d186": "She's looking this way. Did she spot me?",
"E05NMBATH_d187": "Nanami looks completely out of it. What has Madison done to her?",
"E05NMBATH_d188": "That smile... she's proud of herself. Of breaking Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d189": "I just have to grab more soap from over there. You wait here, ok?",
"E05NMBATH_d190": "Rest a little, Nanami. The first time is always intense.",
"E05NMBATH_d191": "First... time?",
"E05NMBATH_d192": "Shit!",
"E05NMBATH_d193": "She's coming this way. I need to move...",
"E05NMBATH_d194": "Enjoying the view, [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05NMBATH_d195": "Pathetic male voyeur.",
"E05NMBATH_d196": "Shit!",
"E05NMBATH_d197": "What you're doing to her is wrong, Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d198": "Whatever, it doesn't matter anyway.",
"E05NMBATH_d199": "She's mine. Only mine.",
"E05NMBATH_d200": "A lesson for you, dear [br_full_r_low] - while men watch, women act.",
"E05NMBATH_d201": "Now go take care of your... problem. Somewhere else.",
"E05NMBATH_d202": "Nanami needs help, but confronting Madison now would only make things worse.",
"E05NMBATH_d203": "Before I tell Nanami exactly what kind of pervert you really are.",
"E05NMBATH_d204": "Whatever... Alright, bye.",
"E05NMBATH_d205": "I need to see what happens next between them...",
"E05NMBATH_d206": "After that kiss and Madison's manipulation, this could get worse.",
"E05NMBATH_d207": "Feels good, right? Being like this with me.",
"E05NMBATH_d208": "No men watching. Just us girls connecting in our special way.",
"E05NMBATH_d209": "Yeah... It feels really nice.",
"E05NMBATH_d210": "Your hands are so gentle, Maddie...",
"E05NMBATH_d211": "And this is normal, right? We don't need to do anything else.",
"E05NMBATH_d212": "Just pure friendship between women, the way it should be.",
"E05NMBATH_d213": "Yes... we are just best friends enjoying our bath.",
"E05NMBATH_d214": "So much better than having disgusting boys around.",
"E05NMBATH_d215": "Maddie, you're hurting me.",
"E05NMBATH_d216": "Your grip is too tight...",
"E05NMBATH_d217": "Sorry. I'll hug you gentler.",
"E05NMBATH_d218": "I just get excited being with someone as beautiful as you.",
"E05NMBATH_d219": "Someone who actually appreciates me, unlike my [fm_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d220": "Ah!",
"E05NMBATH_d221": "M-Maddie! What are you doing?",
"E05NMBATH_d222": "Your hand is...",
"E05NMBATH_d223": "I'm just washing your body.",
"E05NMBATH_d224": "These parts need special attention. They're so perfect.",
"E05NMBATH_d225": "You have a woman's body now, Nanami. So different from before.",
"E05NMBATH_d226": "But... You just pinched...",
"E05NMBATH_d227": "...my nipple.",
"E05NMBATH_d228": "We shouldn't be touching like this...",
"E05NMBATH_d229": "Madison's taking advantage of her.",
"E05NMBATH_d230": "Oh! Sorry! That wasn't on purpose! My fingers just slipped!",
"E05NMBATH_d231": "Don't be shy. Your body is reacting naturally.",
"E05NMBATH_d232": "Ehm... Ok.",
"E05NMBATH_d233": "If you say it's normal...",
"E05NMBATH_d234": "You're so cute, it makes me want to hear more.",
"E05NMBATH_d235": "The sounds you make when I touch you... so pure.",
"E05NMBATH_d236": "Wait... Ah!",
"E05NMBATH_d237": "Your fingers... they're... Ah!!",
"E05NMBATH_d238": "Maddie, this doesn't feel like just bathing anymore...",
"E05NMBATH_d239": "Trust me, Nanami. This is how women show affection.",
"E05NMBATH_d240": "Better than any boy could ever make you feel.",
"E05NMBATH_d241": "What she's doing to Nanami... this is wrong.",
"E05NMBATH_d242": "I should stop this, but if I suddenly appear...",
"E05NMBATH_d243": "Ah, [mc_name].",
"E05NMBATH_d244": "Seems like my [br_full_r_low] was peeping at us.",
"E05NMBATH_d245": "Did you enjoy the show, you pervert?",
"E05NMBATH_d246": "[mc_name]?! Oh no...",
"E05NMBATH_d247": "This isn't... I wasn't...",
"E05NMBATH_d248": "Madison, what the hell are you doing to her?",
"E05NMBATH_d249": "This isn't right and you know it.",
"E05NMBATH_d250": "How was that, dear [br_full_r_low]?",
"E05NMBATH_d251": "Did that turn you on?",
"E05NMBATH_d252": "Watching two women without their permission?",
"E05NMBATH_d253": "This isn't about me. It's about what you're doing to Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d254": "She's not some toy.",
"E05NMBATH_d255": "[br_full_r], join us!",
"E05NMBATH_d256": "Since I caught you watching, might as well participate.",
"E05NMBATH_d257": "Wait! What?",
"E05NMBATH_d258": "[mc_name], I didn't... this isn't what I...",
"E05NMBATH_d259": "Help me teach Nanami how to be a grown-up. It'll be a fun group lesson.",
"E05NMBATH_d260": "Or are you too much of a coward to do more than just watch?",
"E05NMBATH_d261": "Watch how I touch her... learn from this.",
"E05NMBATH_d262": "Nanami doesn't want this, Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d263": "Look at her face.",
"E05NMBATH_d264": "Ah!",
"E05NMBATH_d265": "Stop... Please...",
"E05NMBATH_d266": "[mc_name] is watching us... this is embarrassing...",
"E05NMBATH_d267": "Why? Does it feel bad?",
"E05NMBATH_d268": "Or are you just ashamed to let my [br_full_r_low] see how much you enjoy it?",
"E05NMBATH_d269": "Ahhh!",
"E05NMBATH_d270": "Men watch women all the time. Let him see what he's missing.",
"E05NMBATH_d271": "Ahhhhh!",
"E05NMBATH_d272": "I-It doesn't feel bad, it just....",
"E05NMBATH_d273": "It just feels weird.",
"E05NMBATH_d274": "I've never felt this way before...",
"E05NMBATH_d275": "Your turn, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d276": "Show Nanami what men really do to women.",
"E05NMBATH_d277": "Go on, don't be shy.",
"E05NMBATH_d278": "Prove me right about what disgusting creatures you all are.",
"E05NMBATH_d279": "She's challenging me... Does Madison always do this? Pushing boundaries to see who breaks first.",
"E05NMBATH_d280": "Maybe playing along will expose what she's really doing to Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d281": "Fine, I'll show you how men touch women.",
"E05NMBATH_d282": "Ah! [mc_name]! That hurts! You're too rough!",
"E05NMBATH_d283": "Your hands are squeezing too hard... please...",
"E05NMBATH_d284": "See how he grabs? No finesse. Just taking what he wants.",
"E05NMBATH_d285": "Men always hurt women. They can't help themselves.",
"E05NMBATH_d286": "I'm sorry Nanami, but I can't resist.",
"E05NMBATH_d287": "Your lips look so soft. I need to taste them.",
"E05NMBATH_d288": "Just one kiss. Let me show you what it feels like.",
"E05NMBATH_d289": "Wait!!",
"E05NMBATH_d290": "Please don't... not like this...",
"E05NMBATH_d291": "Now now, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d292": "We can't have that. No kissing.",
"E05NMBATH_d293": "Did you really think I'd let you kiss her? After I just kissed her myself?",
"E05NMBATH_d294": "That's for me to give, not a brute like you.",
"E05NMBATH_d295": "See? That's what men do, when they're alone with girls like you.",
"E05NMBATH_d296": "They hurt you, then try to force themselves on you when you're vulnerable.",
"E05NMBATH_d297": "That's what they're after. You understand now?",
"E05NMBATH_d298": "[mc_name]... I trusted you...",
"E05NMBATH_d299": "What the fuck?! Are you just toying with me?!",
"E05NMBATH_d300": "You set me up! You wanted me to do this!",
"E05NMBATH_d301": "No, no... don't get mad.",
"E05NMBATH_d302": "Your true nature revealed itself. I merely provided the opportunity.",
"E05NMBATH_d303": "This is what all men do when given the chance.",
"E05NMBATH_d304": "I was just showing how boys act around girls like Nanami.",
"E05NMBATH_d305": "They pretend to be gentle, then their hands turn to claws.",
"E05NMBATH_d306": "And that includes you too, [mc_name].",
"E05NMBATH_d307": "Did you see how rough he was, Nanami? How he tried to take what wasn't offered?",
"E05NMBATH_d308": "Now, be a good boy, and leave the bath, will you?",
"E05NMBATH_d309": "Fuck! She played me perfectly...",
"E05NMBATH_d310": "I became exactly what she wanted... a monster.",
"E05NMBATH_d311": "Nanami will never trust me now. I've proven Madison right.",
"E05NMBATH_d312": "There, there, Nanami. Your breasts must hurt from his rough handling.",
"E05NMBATH_d313": "Let me soothe them. Women know how to touch other women properly.",
"E05NMBATH_d314": "You were right about him, Maddie... I should have listened...",
"E05NMBATH_d315": "I won't be part of Madison's game.",
"E05NMBATH_d316": "She wants me to prove her point about men... Not happening.",
"E05NMBATH_d317": "Stop this, Madison.",
"E05NMBATH_d318": "Using Nanami to get at me? That's low.",
"E05NMBATH_d319": "Excuse me?",
"E05NMBATH_d320": "Who do you think you are?",
"E05NMBATH_d321": "I saw what you did. The way you pressured her into this.",
"E05NMBATH_d322": "Mind your own business, [br_full_r_low].",
"E05NMBATH_d323": "You wouldn't understand the connection between women.",
"E05NMBATH_d324": "Nanami, you don't have to do anything you don't want.",
"E05NMBATH_d325": "Don't let her pressure you. This isn't what friendship looks like.",
"E05NMBATH_d326": "You deserve better than being used in her games.",
"E05NMBATH_d327": "Shut up!",
"E05NMBATH_d328": "Don't listen to him, Nanami! He's trying to corrupt you!",
"E05NMBATH_d329": "I... I just wanted to take a bath...",
"E05NMBATH_d330": "I--I think I'd better head out...",
"E05NMBATH_d331": "No!! Where are you going?!",
"E05NMBATH_d332": "I... should get dressed...",
"E05NMBATH_d333": "After everything I've done for you? All the bullies I protected you from?",
"E05NMBATH_d334": "Please let go of my arm, Maddie... you're hurting me...",
"E05NMBATH_d335": "It's all your fault! You!! Get out, NOW!!",
"E05NMBATH_d336": "Leave us alone before you ruin everything else!",
"E05NMBATH_d337": "This is what men do, Nanami. They destroy everything beautiful.",
"E05NMBATH_d338": "Wait... I'll go too.",
"E05NMBATH_d339": "I don't... I don't think I should stay...",
"E05NMBATH_d340": "You're choosing him?",
"E05NMBATH_d341": "After everything I've taught you about men?",
"E05NMBATH_d342": "Nanami, you don't need me or Madison to make your own choices.",
"E05NMBATH_d343": "Trust your instincts. You know what feels right and what doesn't.",
"E05NMBATH_d344": "I... I think I need to stand up for myself...",
"E05NMBATH_d345": "I should go. This is between them now.",
"E05NMBATH_d346": "Maddie, please stop. This isn't what I want.",
"E05NMBATH_d347": "I don't like being used to prove your points about men.",
"E05NMBATH_d348": "You ungrateful little—after all I've done for you?",
"E05NMBATH_d349": "He's poisoned your mind already. Just like all men do.",

"E05ELBD_d001": "Pills for breakfast... lunch... dinner... my whole fucking life.",
"E05ELBD_d002": "Michael doesn't even hide what they're for anymore. 'Take these, Elizabeth. You're getting hysterical again.'",
"E05ELBD_d003": "Just... one more. Just to make the mirror less cruel.",
"E05ELBD_d004": "These aren't even working like they used to...",
"E05ELBD_d005": "White lingerie... so fucking ironic. The virgin bride I never was.",
"E05ELBD_d006": "Twenty years as decoration in this house. Twenty years as... the ornament on his shelf.",
"E05ELBD_d007": "Maybe... maybe if I try to look like I used to... maybe then...",
"E05ELBD_d008": "Who am I kidding? He never looked at me. Just through me.",
"E05ELBD_d009": "[mo_full_r] always said... always said... what was it? Beauty is... is currency.",
"E05ELBD_d010": "My only value... gone.",
"E05ELBD_d011": "Bankrupt. Fucking worthless now.",
"E05ELBD_d012": "Can't even remember... what I'm supposed to be thinking about...",
"E05ELBD_d013": "Orange... like sunset in Milan. Sunset on my worth.",
"E05ELBD_d014": "They called me The European Rose... now I'm just... just dried petals.",
"E05ELBD_d015": "The perfect color... Orange to match his ties at medical galas.",
"E05ELBD_d016": "Why can't I... why can't I make this body beautiful again?",
"E05ELBD_d017": "Naked... naked is easier. No more... pretending.",
"E05ELBD_d018": "Just meat on bones... just a body past its expiration date.",
"E05ELBD_d019": "All those eyes staring at me...",
"E05ELBD_d020": "Like I'm already a corpse.",
"E05ELBD_d021": "Pink... like my first Vogue cover. Fucking lifetime ago.",
"E05ELBD_d022": "These tits... these saggy, stretch-marked tits... used to make headlines.",
"E05ELBD_d023": "Now they're just... evidence. Evidence of decay.",
"E05ELBD_d024": "Maybe the wine will make me see what he saw. What everyone saw. Before...",
"E05ELBD_d025": "Red... always wore red in Milan. Red like... like...",
"E05ELBD_d026": "Like all that wine in my blood. Only thing real about me now.",

"E05_ELSUI_d006": "[mc_name]-san!",
"E05_ELSUI_d007": "Sorry for startling you!",
"E05_ELSUI_d008": "Nanami? What brings you to the hospital?",
"E05_ELSUI_d009": "I brought these flowers for your mom!",
"E05_ELSUI_d010": "When Madison told me what happened, I... I wanted to help somehow.",
"E05_ELSUI_d011": "That's really sweet of you. Thank you.",
"E05_ELSUI_d012": "Did Madison come with you?",
"E05_ELSUI_d013": "She's in the cafeteria yelling at the cashier about juice prices.",
"E05_ELSUI_d014": "Something about... um... 'guys always ripping off girls?'",
"E05_ELSUI_d015": "Yeah, that sounds like Madison alright.",
"E05_ELSUI_d016": "She looks embarrassed about something. More than just Madison's drama.",
"E05_ELSUI_d017": "Um... [mc_name]-san? About that night when I got really drunk...",
"E05_ELSUI_d018": "I keep remembering... w-weird stuff. Like bits and pieces.",
"E05_ELSUI_d019": "Madison said it would be fun to drink with you, and that I should... you know...",
"E05_ELSUI_d020": "What exactly do you remember, Nanami?",
"E05_ELSUI_d021": "It's kinda embarrassing to talk about here...",
"E05_ELSUI_d022": "C-could we sit down here? In the waiting area?",
"E05_ELSUI_d023": "Sure. Let's sit.",
"E05_ELSUI_d024": "I knew this conversation would happen eventually.",
"E05_ELSUI_d025": "I remember... taking my clothes off.",
"E05_ELSUI_d026": "And you... touching me in places that felt weird.",
"E05_ELSUI_d027": "Madison told me that's what I was supposed to do if I liked someone.",
"E05_ELSUI_d028": "Nanami, I'm really sorry about that night.",
"E05_ELSUI_d029": "Madison shouldn't have told you to get drunk and act that way.",
"E05_ELSUI_d030": "But she said if I liked someone, I should show them by letting them touch me...",
"E05_ELSUI_d031": "Madison gives terrible advice. What happened wasn't your fault.",
"E05_ELSUI_d032": "You were drunk and confused. You didn't do anything wrong.",
"E05_ELSUI_d033": "But Madison said I was supposed to act like that around guys I liked...",
"E05_ELSUI_d034": "Madison doesn't always give good advice about this stuff.",
"E05_ELSUI_d035": "Shit... Madison gave her that advice because she wanted Nanami to act that way with her, not with guys.",
"E05_ELSUI_d036": "You shouldn't feel bad about following crappy advice.",
"E05_ELSUI_d037": "S-so Madison was totally wrong?",
"E05_ELSUI_d038": "Did I mess up that night? You stopped when things got... hot.",
"E05_ELSUI_d039": "You didn't mess up. I stopped because I realized the situation wasn't right.",
"E05_ELSUI_d040": "I should've been more responsible that night.",
"E05_ELSUI_d041": "Then why did you touch me if it was wrong?",
"E05_ELSUI_d042": "Did I do something bad? You seemed into it but then you just... stopped.",
"E05_ELSUI_d043": "I stopped because I realized what we were doing wasn't okay, even if it felt good.",
"E05_ELSUI_d044": "I'm older. I should've stopped things right away.",
"E05_ELSUI_d045": "So you AND Madison are both teaching me wrong stuff?",
"E05_ELSUI_d046": "I thought... older people were supposed to know better!",
"E05_ELSUI_d047": "You're right to be mad. We both screwed up.",
"E05_ELSUI_d048": "That night was confusing for everyone.",
"E05_ELSUI_d049": "So you AND Madison are both teaching me wrong things?",
"E05_ELSUI_d050": "How am I supposed to know what's right if you guys don't even know?",
"E05_ELSUI_d051": "Sometimes older people mess up too, Nanami. Big time.",
"E05_ELSUI_d052": "Then who am I supposed to trust?",
"E05_ELSUI_d053": "Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it's okay to say no.",
"E05_ELSUI_d054": "Like when I made that gross pudding with salt instead of sugar!",
"E05_ELSUI_d055": "I trusted the recipe but I totally read it wrong and Mom made the worst face!",
"E05_ELSUI_d056": "That's not really reassuring...",
"E05_ELSUI_d057": "I know it's confusing, but trusting your instincts is important.",
"E05_ELSUI_d058": "Like when I made that nasty salty pudding thinking it said sugar!",
"E05_ELSUI_d059": "I should've tasted it first instead of just trusting I read it right!",
"E05_ELSUI_d060": "That's... not really the same thing, Nanami.",
"E05_ELSUI_d061": "But it was REALLY gross pudding! Mom said it was like eating cake-flavored seawater!",
"E05_ELSUI_d062": "She's trying to make light of this with her innocent comparisons. It's actually kind of sweet.",
"E05_ELSUI_d063": "These flowers are from our garden. Mom said bright colors help people get better.",
"E05_ELSUI_d064": "I'm sure my mother will love them when she wakes up.",
"E05_ELSUI_d065": "Madison said your mom had some kind of... accident?",
"E05_ELSUI_d066": "Something like that. She's gonna be okay though.",
"E05_ELSUI_d067": "Oh good! I was really w-worried when Madison told me.",
"E05_ELSUI_d068": "Daddy... can I ask you something kinda p-personal?",
"E05_ELSUI_d069": "[mc_name]-san... can I ask you something that's been bugging me?",
"E05_ELSUI_d070": "What's on your mind?",
"E05_ELSUI_d071": "When Madison touches me... in certain places...",
"E05_ELSUI_d072": "It makes me feel weird but not... not bad weird. Is that normal?",
"E05_ELSUI_d073": "Nanami, we probably shouldn't discuss this stuff.",
"E05_ELSUI_d074": "But I can't ask Madison 'cause she's the one doing it!",
"E05_ELSUI_d075": "And Mom's always working, and the school nurse just gave me some dumb pamphlet about periods!",
"E05_ELSUI_d076": "You should really talk to your mom about these feelings when she has time.",
"E05_ELSUI_d077": "But you're the only older person I feel okay asking!",
"E05_ELSUI_d078": "Those physical feelings are normal for someone your age.",
"E05_ELSUI_d079": "So I'm not weird or broken?",
"E05_ELSUI_d080": "You're totally normal. But what Madison's doing crosses lines.",
"E05_ELSUI_d081": "Even if I kinda... like how it feels sometimes?",
"E05_ELSUI_d082": "Even then. These should be experiences you choose when you're ready.",
"E05_ELSUI_d083": "Madison says I'm not too young though. She says I'm developing way faster than other girls.",
"E05_ELSUI_d084": "Look, I'm already bigger than her!",
"E05_ELSUI_d085": "Madison says I'm developing super fast and that means I'm ready for these feelings.",
"E05_ELSUI_d086": "See? I'm already bigger than Madison!",
"E05_ELSUI_d087": "Nanami, please sit back down.",
"E05_ELSUI_d088": "Shit, this is getting uncomfortable. She's trying to get me to look at her body.",
"E05_ELSUI_d089": "Madison likes to... check out how I've grown. She says it's normal girl friendship stuff.",
"E05_ELSUI_d090": "That's exactly what worries me about your relationship with her.",
"E05_ELSUI_d091": "So Madison's a bad person?",
"E05_ELSUI_d092": "Madison's not bad, but she has serious boundary problems.",
"E05_ELSUI_d093": "So I should keep letting her touch me since we're friends?",
"E05_ELSUI_d094": "No. Even friends need to respect boundaries.",
"E05_ELSUI_d095": "But Madison says all close friends do this kind of stuff together.",
"E05_ELSUI_d096": "Madison's wrong about that.",
"E05_ELSUI_d097": "What Madison's doing to you isn't okay, no matter what her reasons are.",
"E05_ELSUI_d098": "So I should keep letting her touch me 'cause she's my best friend?",
"E05_ELSUI_d099": "No. Real friends don't pressure you into stuff that makes you uncomfortable.",
"E05_ELSUI_d100": "But Madison says this is how all girlfriends bond.",
"E05_ELSUI_d101": "Madison's manipulating you when she says stuff like that.",
"E05_ELSUI_d102": "But you're my friend too, right? And you never make me do that stuff!",
"E05_ELSUI_d103": "Exactly. That's how healthy friendships work.",
"E05_ELSUI_d104": "You're my favorite person, Daddy!",
"E05_ELSUI_d105": "You're my favorite person, [mc_name]-san!",
"E05_ELSUI_d106": "Madison told me hugs need to last like twenty seconds to release oxy... oxy-something.",
"E05_ELSUI_d107": "Oxytocin. It's a bonding hormone.",
"E05_ELSUI_d108": "Can we try a real twenty-second hug? I really need one right now.",
"E05_ELSUI_d109": "Of course. One... two... three...",
"E05_ELSUI_d110": "This seems innocent enough. She clearly needs comfort.",
"E05_ELSUI_d111": "Madison never lets me finish counting. She always starts touching other places around ten seconds.",
"E05_ELSUI_d112": "This position is getting uncomfortable. She's sitting right on... I should say something.",
"E05_ELSUI_d113": "Fourteen... fifteen... sixteen...",
"E05_ELSUI_d114": "Just a few more seconds. Don't make this weird for her.",
"E05_ELSUI_d115": "This feels safe and warm. I always wondered what having a protective father would feel like.",
"E05_ELSUI_d116": "She's just looking for the paternal comfort she never had. But this position is problematic.",
"E05_ELSUI_d117": "Nineteen... twenty!",
"E05_ELSUI_d118": "Do I push her away and risk hurting her feelings? Let it slide this once? Or just... accept that she needs this right now?",
"E05_ELSUI_d119": "Nanami, you need to get off my lap. Now.",
"E05_ELSUI_d120": "Did I do something wrong again?",
"E05_ELSUI_d121": "This position isn't appropriate for us. We can't sit like this.",
"E05_ELSUI_d122": "I'm s-sorry... I just wanted to feel safe for a sec.",
"E05_ELSUI_d123": "I know, but this crosses a line. Please understand.",
"E05_ELSUI_d124": "Nanami, while that was nice, sitting on my lap isn't something we should do regularly.",
"E05_ELSUI_d125": "Really? But it feels so natural and comfy!",
"E05_ELSUI_d126": "I always imagined this is what having a dad would feel like!",
"E05_ELSUI_d127": "I get that you're looking for that connection, but we need boundaries.",
"E05_ELSUI_d128": "But you take care of me like one would! What's the difference?",
"E05_ELSUI_d129": "The difference is we need to keep things appropriate between us.",
"E05_ELSUI_d130": "There. Twenty seconds exactly.",
"E05_ELSUI_d131": "See? Madison was right about the oxytocin! I do feel way better!",
"E05_ELSUI_d132": "Can we do this more often? It feels like what family should be.",
"E05_ELSUI_d133": "If it helps you feel better... I guess we can do this sometimes.",
"E05_ELSUI_d134": "Really? Thank you so much! You're the best!",
"E05_ELSUI_d135": "I'm probably going to regret this decision...",

"E05_MADHO_d001": "Well, well... isn't this cozy?",
"E05_MADHO_d002": "M-Madison! We were just talking!",
"E05_MADHO_d003": "About what exactly, sweetie?",
"E05_MADHO_d004": "Fuck. How long has she been standing there?",
"E05_MADHO_d005": "[mc_name]-san says you shouldn't touch me in private places even if it feels nice sometimes!",
"E05_MADHO_d006": "Is that what he said? How interesting.",
"E05_MADHO_d007": "Nanami, be a dear and get us some coffee from the cafeteria.",
"E05_MADHO_d008": "But I don't really like coffee...",
"E05_MADHO_d009": "Then get yourself a hot chocolate. Take your time.",
"E05_MADHO_d010": "Will you both be here when I get back?",
"E05_MADHO_d011": "Oh yes. We'll be right here having a nice little chat.",
"E05_MADHO_d012": "Remember what we talked about, Daddy. Twenty seconds.",
"E05_MADHO_d013": "Twenty seconds? And 'Daddy'? How precious.",
"E05_MADHO_d014": "Remember what we talked about, [mc_name]-san. Twenty seconds.",
"E05_MADHO_d015": "Twenty seconds? How sweet.",
"E05_MADHO_d016": "I need to get Nanami away from this psycho.",
"E05_MADHO_d017": "Tell me, did you enjoy having her on your lap? Did it remind you of when she was drunk and you felt her up?",
"E05_MADHO_d018": "Tell me, did you enjoy having her on your lap? Did it remind you of all those times you've fantasized about her?",
"E05_MADHO_d019": "She's trying to piss me off. Do I take the bait?",
"E05_MADHO_d020": "Madison, let's not do this here. We both care about Nanami.",
"E05_MADHO_d021": "Care? Is that what you call groping vulnerable girls?",
"E05_MADHO_d022": "I was comforting her. There's a difference.",
"E05_MADHO_d023": "Is there? Because from where I'm standing, you're just another predator.",
"E05_MADHO_d024": "You're one to talk about inappropriate touching.",
"E05_MADHO_d025": "At least I'm honest about what I want.",
"E05_MADHO_d026": "You're grooming her. Using her trust.",
"E05_MADHO_d027": "And what are you doing? Playing the hero while getting your rocks off?",
"E05_MADHO_d028": "I saw how you looked at her. How you held her.",
"E05_MADHO_d029": "I'm trying to protect her from you.",
"E05_MADHO_d030": "By offering yourself as an alternative? How noble of you, big brother.",
"E05_MADHO_d031": "Remember, you owe me a favor. Or did you forget about the photo?",
"E05_MADHO_d032": "Shit. That topless selfie she took with me.",
"E05_MADHO_d033": "You want her just as much as I do. The difference is I admit it.",
"E05_MADHO_d034": "You're sick.",
"E05_MADHO_d035": "We're all sick, brother. Some of us just embrace it.",
"E05_MADHO_d036": "I said we'd talk, didn't I? There's something I need... I want something for me and Nanami, and—",
"E05_MADHO_d037": "Not now, Madison. Drop it.",
"E05_MADHO_d038": "Can't let her finish that thought.",
"E05_MADHO_d039": "I'm going to make sure everyone knows what you're really doing to her.",
"E05_MADHO_d040": "With what proof? Your word against mine?",
"E05_MADHO_d041": "I'll tell Mom and Dad exactly what their precious daughter is up to.",
"E05_MADHO_d042": "They won't believe you. I'm their perfect little angel.",
"E05_MADHO_d043": "We'll see about that when I show them the evidence.",
"E05_MADHO_d044": "People are going to start noticing things, Madison.",
"E05_MADHO_d045": "What people? What things?",
"E05_MADHO_d046": "Your behavior isn't as subtle as you think. Eventually someone will put the pieces together.",
"E05_MADHO_d047": "The word of a man who lets a young girl call him 'Daddy'? Good luck with that.",
"E05_MADHO_d048": "The word of a man who gets off on vulnerable girls? Good luck with that.",
"E05_MADHO_d049": "Nobody will believe you. I'm just a caring friend helping a lonely girl.",
"E05_MADHO_d050": "Stay away from her, and I won't have to expose your little fantasies.",
"E05_MADHO_d051": "This isn't over.",
"E05_MADHO_d052": "I'll tell her you had an emergency and had to leave.",
"E05_MADHO_d053": "You know what? I can see how much you want her.",
"E05_MADHO_d054": "What are you talking about?",
"E05_MADHO_d055": "I'll make a sacrifice. I'll give you what you really want.",
"E05_MADHO_d056": "What kind of game is she playing now?",
"E05_MADHO_d057": "I'll give you my body instead of hers. Isn't that generous of me?",
"E05_MADHO_d058": "What?!",
"E05_MADHO_d059": "I'm protecting her purity. Someone has to keep her innocent.",
"E05_MADHO_d060": "This is some twisted logic.",
"E05_MADHO_d061": "I'm sacrificing myself so you won't corrupt her. I'm such a saint.",
"E05_MADHO_d062": "Madison, what the hell are you doing?",
"E05_MADHO_d063": "Being noble. Offering my body to save hers.",
"E05_MADHO_d064": "This is fucked up, but... damn.",
"E05_MADHO_d065": "Mmm... see? I'm willing to let you use me to protect sweet, innocent Nanami.",
"E05_MADHO_d066": "This is fucking wrong... ahhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d067": "Wrong? I'm being selfless here. My body for her virtue.",
"E05_MADHO_d068": "My dick doesn't care about her twisted logic right now.",
"E05_MADHO_d069": "We shouldn't be... ohhhh fuck...",
"E05_MADHO_d070": "Mmmmph... you're right. But I'm sacrificing my body for her sake.",
"E05_MADHO_d071": "Stop with the martyr bullshit... ahhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d072": "Why am I not walking away?",
"E05_MADHO_d073": "Mmmm... I'm literally offering my body to keep you away from her. Ahhh... I'm amazing.",
"E05_MADHO_d074": "You're fucking delusional... ohh god...",
"E05_MADHO_d075": "Delusional? Mmmmph... I'm being the perfect protector here.",
"E05_MADHO_d076": "God, she's insane but this feels good.",
"E05_MADHO_d077": "Stop talking and just... ahhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d078": "Mmmph... just what? Appreciate my physical sacrifice? Ohhhh... I'm practically a hero.",
"E05_MADHO_d079": "Your mouth feels so fucking good...",
"E05_MADHO_d080": "I should walk away but fuck it.",
"E05_MADHO_d081": "Mmmmph... you're thinking about her, aren't you? About sweet little Nanami?",
"E05_MADHO_d082": "I'm thinking about... ahhh... shutting you up.",
"E05_MADHO_d083": "Mmmm... but you can't have her. Only I can. So you'll settle for me.",
"E05_MADHO_d084": "Fuck. She's getting in my head again.",
"E05_MADHO_d085": "Mmmmph... this is what you wanted to do to her, isn't it?",
"E05_MADHO_d086": "This is about you being a... ohhhh... manipulative bitch.",
"E05_MADHO_d087": "Mmmm... poor Nanami. If only she knew what 'Daddy' really wants to do to her.",
"E05_MADHO_d088": "Why does that turn me on more?",
"E05_MADHO_d089": "You're the sick one... ahhhh... here.",
"E05_MADHO_d090": "Mmmph... then why is your cock getting harder every time I mention her?",
"E05_MADHO_d091": "Because you're sucking it so good, psycho... ohhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d092": "Mmmmm... keep telling yourself that, brother.",
"E05_MADHO_d093": "Ahhh... ready for the real fun?",
"E05_MADHO_d094": "Do whatever you want... just stop talking about her.",
"E05_MADHO_d095": "But talking about Nanami makes you throb. Feel that? Mmmmm...",
"E05_MADHO_d096": "Shit. She's right and she knows it.",
"E05_MADHO_d097": "Ohhhh... I'm giving you something she never could. My body, willingly sacrificed.",
"E05_MADHO_d098": "Madison, we can't keep... ahhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d099": "Mmmm... can't keep what? Using my body while fantasizing about her pure one?",
"E05_MADHO_d100": "You're seriously fucked up... but that feels amazing...",
"E05_MADHO_d101": "Ahhhh... what if Nanami came back right now and caught us?",
"E05_MADHO_d102": "Then we should... ohhhh... stop.",
"E05_MADHO_d103": "Mmmm... she'd see how I sacrifice myself to protect her. What a good friend I am.",
"E05_MADHO_d104": "Fuck. Why does that idea turn me on?",
"E05_MADHO_d105": "Not yet... ahhhh... I want you inside me when you come. My body taking what was meant for hers.",
"E05_MADHO_d106": "This is insane...",
"E05_MADHO_d107": "Mmmm... insane is watching you pretend to be noble while thinking about fucking her.",
"E05_MADHO_d108": "She's completely lost it.",
"E05_MADHO_d109": "Look at me... ohhhhh... really look.",
"E05_MADHO_d110": "I'm looking...",
"E05_MADHO_d111": "No, you're seeing what you want Nanami to become. But she's pure. Only I can be dirty for you.",
"E05_MADHO_d112": "Damn her. She's fucking right.",
"E05_MADHO_d113": "Ahhhhhh... this is what you really want, isn't it? Her body, but you'll settle for mine.",
"E05_MADHO_d114": "You're twisting everything...",
"E05_MADHO_d115": "Mmmm... I'm protecting her innocence by giving you mine.",
"E05_MADHO_d116": "I want to deny it but... fuck.",
"E05_MADHO_d117": "Say it... ohhhhh... say you want to fuck her.",
"E05_MADHO_d118": "Go fuck yourself...",
"E05_MADHO_d119": "Ahhhh... you can't have her. But you can have me. Isn't that generous?",
"E05_MADHO_d120": "She's breaking me down piece by piece.",
"E05_MADHO_d121": "Feel how wet I am? Ahhhhh... that's because I'm sacrificing my body for her purity.",
"E05_MADHO_d122": "What the fuck is wrong with you?",
"E05_MADHO_d123": "Mmmm... I'm being noble. My corruption for her innocence.",
"E05_MADHO_d124": "Shut the fuck up and just... ohhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d125": "Ahhhhhh... imagine if she walked in. She'd see how I sacrifice myself to protect her.",
"E05_MADHO_d126": "Don't you dare... ohhhh fuck...",
"E05_MADHO_d127": "Mmmm... she'd be so grateful. So proud of her selfless friend.",
"E05_MADHO_d128": "Why the hell does that thought make me harder?",
"E05_MADHO_d129": "Fuck... your ass is so tight... ahhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d130": "Ohhhhhh... tighter than you imagined hers would be?",
"E05_MADHO_d131": "Stop bringing her into this... holy shit...",
"E05_MADHO_d132": "Ahhhh... she's why we're here. I'm protecting her by giving you this.",
"E05_MADHO_d133": "Mmmmmph... what do you think innocent Nanami would say if she walked in right now?",
"E05_MADHO_d134": "I said stop... ohhhh god...",
"E05_MADHO_d135": "Ahhhhhh... she'd see what a good friend I am. Sacrificing my body for her virtue.",
"E05_MADHO_d136": "The image is driving me fucking crazy.",
"E05_MADHO_d137": "Ohhhhh... would she still call you Daddy after seeing you fuck me like an animal?",
"E05_MADHO_d138": "Madison, please... ahhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d139": "Mmmmm... she'd understand. I'm taking the corruption so she can stay pure.",
"E05_MADHO_d140": "Ahhhhhh... would she still trust you after seeing you fuck me like this?",
"E05_MADHO_d141": "Madison, please... ohhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d142": "Mmmm... she'd be grateful. I'm protecting her innocence with my sacrifice.",
"E05_MADHO_d143": "You're the one... ahhhhh... manipulating her.",
"E05_MADHO_d144": "Ohhhhhh... and you're the one dreaming about splitting her open. But I'm giving you mine instead.",
"E05_MADHO_d145": "That's not— fuck, you feel so good... ahhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d146": "She's winning this mind game.",
"E05_MADHO_d147": "Harder! Ahhhhhh... every time she sits on your lap, you think about this!",
"E05_MADHO_d148": "Shut the fuck— ohhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d149": "Mmmmmph... but I'm protecting her. My body for her purity.",
"E05_MADHO_d150": "Can't deny it anymore.",
"E05_MADHO_d151": "Fuck me like you want to fuck her! Ahhhhhhh... use my body so hers stays pure!",
"E05_MADHO_d152": "This isn't about her... ohhhhhh fuck...",
"E05_MADHO_d153": "Everything is about her! Mmmmph... I'm sacrificing myself for her innocence!",
"E05_MADHO_d154": "She's completely dominating me.",
"E05_MADHO_d155": "Look at me and tell me... ahhhhhh... you don't want to see her face when you first push inside.",
"E05_MADHO_d156": "I... I don't... ohhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d157": "Mmmmmph... but you can't have her. So you'll use me. What a saint I am.",
"E05_MADHO_d158": "She's completely broken my defenses.",
"E05_MADHO_d159": "That's it! Ahhhhhhh... show me what you want to do to her innocent body!",
"E05_MADHO_d160": "This is about you... ohhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d161": "Mmmmmph... this is about protecting her. I'm the sacrifice.",
"E05_MADHO_d162": "Why does she have to be this right?",
"E05_MADHO_d163": "You're a sick, twisted bitch... ahhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d164": "Ohhhhhh... I'm a martyr. Giving my body to protect hers.",
"E05_MADHO_d165": "I'm nothing like you... ohhhh fuck...",
"E05_MADHO_d166": "Mmmmmph... keep telling yourself that while you fuck me thinking about her.",
"E05_MADHO_d167": "Say her name! Ahhhhhh... say 'Nanami' and I'll let you come!",
"E05_MADHO_d168": "No... I won't... ohhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d169": "Mmmmmph... you can't have her, but you can say her name while using me.",
"E05_MADHO_d170": "I'm losing this battle completely.",
"E05_MADHO_d171": "Feel how tight I am? Ahhhhhhh... I'm sacrificing this tightness to protect hers.",
"E05_MADHO_d172": "Stop it... ohhhhhh fuck...",
"E05_MADHO_d173": "Mmmmmph... young, innocent, virgin tight. But mine, not hers. Aren't I generous?",
"E05_MADHO_d174": "The image is too fucking perfect.",
"E05_MADHO_d175": "Shut up! Just shut the fuck up... ahhhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d176": "Make me! Ohhhhhh... use my body like you want to use hers!",
"E05_MADHO_d177": "You feel so fucking good... mmmmmph...",
"E05_MADHO_d178": "Need to end this before I lose myself completely.",
"E05_MADHO_d179": "Yes! Harder, Daddy! Ahhhhhhh... show me what she's missing!",
"E05_MADHO_d180": "Don't call me that... ohhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d181": "Mmmmmph... why not? You love when she does. But I'm the one sacrificing for her.",
"E05_MADHO_d182": "She's completely conquered me.",
"E05_MADHO_d183": "I'm close... so fucking close... ahhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d184": "Think about her! Ohhhhhh... think about the innocence I'm protecting!",
"E05_MADHO_d185": "Nanami... ohhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d186": "Fuck. I said her name. Madison won.",
"E05_MADHO_d187": "Fuck... I'm coming... Nanami! Ahhhhhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d188": "That's it! Ohhhhhh... come thinking about what you can't have! Fill me up!",
"E05_MADHO_d189": "Holy shit... mmmmmph...",
"E05_MADHO_d190": "What the fuck have I become?",
"E05_MADHO_d191": "Mmmmmm... feel better now? I just saved her virtue with my sacrifice.",
"E05_MADHO_d192": "This was a mistake...",
"E05_MADHO_d193": "No, this was noble. I protected her innocence by taking your seed.",
"E05_MADHO_d194": "I'm pulling out... Nanami! Ahhhhhhhhh...",
"E05_MADHO_d195": "That's it! Ohhhhhh... come thinking about what you can't have!",
"E05_MADHO_d196": "Holy shit... mmmmmph...",
"E05_MADHO_d197": "What the fuck have I become?",
"E05_MADHO_d198": "Clean yourself up. Your precious Nanami will be back soon.",
"E05_MADHO_d199": "How do I face her after this?",
"E05_MADHO_d200": "With gratitude. I just protected her purity for you.",
"E05_MADHO_d201": "That was enlightening.",
"E05_MADHO_d202": "What do you want?",
"E05_MADHO_d203": "I think we understand each other perfectly now.",
"E05_MADHO_d204": "She played me like a fucking violin.",
"E05_MADHO_d205": "We understand each other now, right? Nanami is mine. You stay away from her.",
"E05_MADHO_d206": "Fine. You win.",
"E05_MADHO_d207": "I knew you'd see reason.",
"E05_MADHO_d208": "Just... don't hurt her.",
"E05_MADHO_d209": "Hurt her? I just sacrificed my body to protect her.",
"E05_MADHO_d210": "This isn't over. I won't let you control her.",
"E05_MADHO_d211": "After what just happened? You think you have any moral authority?",
"E05_MADHO_d212": "I'll find a way to protect her.",
"E05_MADHO_d213": "From what? I'm the one protecting her virtue.",
"E05_MADHO_d214": "Smart choice. I'll keep sacrificing myself to keep her pure.",
"E05_MADHO_d215": "Oh, I hope you try. I'll just have to sacrifice more to protect her.",
"E05_MADHO_d216": "By the way, I recorded our entire conversation today... and everything that just happened.",
"E05_MADHO_d217": "You what?",
"E05_MADHO_d218": "Every word about your fantasies with Nanami. Every moan. Every time you said her name while fucking me.",
"E05_MADHO_d219": "You're insane. Delete that.",
"E05_MADHO_d220": "Imagine how it would sound to her mother? Or the police? 'Daddy' having sexual fantasies about a vulnerable girl?",
"E05_MADHO_d221": "You wouldn't dare.",
"E05_MADHO_d222": "Try me. Stay away from her, and this little recording stays between us.",
"E05_MADHO_d223": "But if you interfere with my friendship with Nanami again...",
"E05_MADHO_d224": "You sick bitch.",
"E05_MADHO_d225": "I prefer 'protective friend.' Now, I'll tell her you had an emergency and had to leave.",
"E05_MADHO_d226": "She played me perfectly. Every fucking move calculated.",
"E05_MADHO_d227": "Now she has all the power.",
"E05_MADHO_d228": "Nanami's walking back into a trap and doesn't even know it.",
"E05_MADHO_d229": "Let's take this somewhere a little more... peaceful. Wouldn't want any distractions, right?",
"E05_MADHO_d230": "Save it—I'm done. I'm out.",

"E05_PAZHO_d001": "Phone's buzzing. Shit, who calls this late?",
"E05_PAZHO_d002": "Still fucked up from that whole Madison thing.",
"E05_PAZHO_d003": "Wait, that's Paz.",
"E05_PAZHO_d004": "Video call? What the hell does she want at this hour?",
"E05_PAZHO_d005": "Hope it's not more bad news.",
"E05_PAZHO_d006": "Better see what's up.",

"E05_PAZCA_d001": "Hey partner. You look like you've been through hell.",
"E05_PAZCA_d002": "Thanks for the pep talk. Hospital chairs aren't exactly comfortable.",
"E05_PAZCA_d003": "How's your mom doing?",
"E05_PAZCA_d004": "Stable now. Doctors got her sedated.",
"E05_PAZCA_d005": "That's good. Must have been scary as hell.",
"E05_PAZCA_d006": "Yeah, it was. What's going on with you? Working late again?",
"E05_PAZCA_d007": "Remember when I asked if I should grab that key from evidence?",
"E05_PAZCA_d008": "Yeah, and I told you it was risky as hell.",
"E05_PAZCA_d009": "Well... I did it anyway.",
"E05_PAZCA_d010": "Damn, Paz. What if you'd been caught?",
"E05_PAZCA_d011": "Look, I know you had your doubts, but something felt off about this whole thing.",
"E05_PAZCA_d012": "My gut told me to do it, so I did.",
"E05_PAZCA_d013": "How the hell did you even pull that off?",
"E05_PAZCA_d014": "You know Takahashi? The evidence clerk who's always eye-fucking me?",
"E05_PAZCA_d015": "The creepy one? Yeah.",
"E05_PAZCA_d016": "Let's just say I finally put his wandering eyes to good use.",
"E05_PAZCA_d017": "Please tell me you didn't sleep with that pervert.",
"E05_PAZCA_d018": "God no. But I gave him a little... show.",
"E05_PAZCA_d019": "Few wardrobe adjustments, some strategic positioning...",
"E05_PAZCA_d020": "You used your tits to distract him?",
"E05_PAZCA_d021": "Hey, if he's gonna stare anyway, might as well make it work for me.",
"E05_PAZCA_d022": "That's... actually pretty smart.",
"E05_PAZCA_d023": "While he was drooling, I snagged what I needed.",
"E05_PAZCA_d024": "Got some interesting info too.",
"E05_PAZCA_d025": "What kind of info?",
"E05_PAZCA_d026": "That ritual setup in your apartment? I've never seen anything like it in any other case.",
"E05_PAZCA_d027": "But here's the weird part - the department's treating this like it's priority one.",
"E05_PAZCA_d028": "More than murder cases?",
"E05_PAZCA_d029": "Exactly. We've got bodies piling up, but they're obsessing over some bells and candles.",
"E05_PAZCA_d030": "Also found references to doctors in different cities. Dr. Watanabe here in Osaka, others elsewhere.",
"E05_PAZCA_d031": "All connected to yakuza families somehow. Don't know what they need doctors for, but it can't be good.",
"E05_PAZCA_d032": "Sounds like someone's trying to cover something up.",
"E05_PAZCA_d033": "That's what I'm thinking.",
"E05_PAZCA_d034": "[mc_name], I need to tell you something else. About that lie I told Kimura.",
"E05_PAZCA_d035": "About us being together?",
"E05_PAZCA_d036": "Yeah. It's becoming a problem.",
"E05_PAZCA_d037": "How so?",
"E05_PAZCA_d038": "He keeps asking questions. Personal stuff.",
"E05_PAZCA_d039": "And I realized I don't know how to answer them.",
"E05_PAZCA_d040": "What do you mean?",
"E05_PAZCA_d041": "I mean... I've never actually been with a guy, [mc_name].",
"E05_PAZCA_d042": "Wait, really? I knew you were bi, but I thought you'd been with both.",
"E05_PAZCA_d043": "Nope. All my experience has been with women.",
"E05_PAZCA_d044": "Shit, Paz. That must make this even harder.",
"E05_PAZCA_d045": "You know how this department is. How they talk about anyone who's different.",
"E05_PAZCA_d046": "Being hafu already makes us outsiders. But being hafu AND not straight?",
"E05_PAZCA_d047": "Shit, I never thought about it like that.",
"E05_PAZCA_d048": "Remember when we first partnered up? We were the department's token foreigners.",
"E05_PAZCA_d049": "Yeah, the gaijin kids who somehow made it through the academy.",
"E05_PAZCA_d050": "Exactly. At least you just had to deal with the 'foreign parents' thing.",
"E05_PAZCA_d051": "I've got that plus being mixed-race, and now this sexuality shit on top of it.",
"E05_PAZCA_d052": "So when you said we were together...",
"E05_PAZCA_d053": "I panicked. Used you as cover because you're the only one who gets what it's like being the outsider.",
"E05_PAZCA_d054": "But now Kimura wants details, and I don't know what the fuck to tell him.",
"E05_PAZCA_d055": "What kind of details?",
"E05_PAZCA_d056": "How you touch me. What you like. What I do for you.",
"E05_PAZCA_d057": "I--.",
"E05_PAZCA_d058": "I know it's fucked up, but I need your help.",
"E05_PAZCA_d059": "Help with what exactly?",
"E05_PAZCA_d060": "Teaching me how to be convincing. How to act like I know what I'm doing with men.",
"E05_PAZCA_d061": "I trust you, [mc_name]. And who else am I gonna ask?",
"E05_PAZCA_d062": "That's... that's a hell of a request, Paz.",
"E05_PAZCA_d063": "I know. But I'm asking anyway.",
"E05_PAZCA_d064": "What exactly are you asking me to do?",
"E05_PAZCA_d065": "Show me. Teach me what men want.",
"E05_PAZCA_d066": "Over a video call?",
"E05_PAZCA_d067": "It's a start, isn't it?",
"E05_PAZCA_d068": "Fuck. After Madison's mind games, this feels... different.",
"E05_PAZCA_d069": "Paz isn't manipulating me. She's just asking for help.",
"E05_PAZCA_d070": "I know it's weird. But I'm tired of faking everything.",
"E05_PAZCA_d071": "And you think this will help?",
"E05_PAZCA_d072": "I hope so. Will you help me?",
"E05_PAZCA_d073": "She actually looks worried. This isn't some game.",
"E05_PAZCA_d074": "This is my partner asking for help.",
"E05_PAZCA_d075": "Alright. But this stays between us.",
"E05_PAZCA_d076": "Of course. I wouldn't ask if I didn't trust you completely.",
"E05_PAZCA_d077": "First thing - confidence. Men like to see you're into it.",
"E05_PAZCA_d078": "Like this?",
"E05_PAZCA_d079": "Yeah, that's good. Natural.",
"E05_PAZCA_d080": "She's actually pretty good at this.",
"E05_PAZCA_d081": "Eye contact is important. Don't look away when you want something.",
"E05_PAZCA_d082": "Is this too much? I feel like I'm performing in a bad porn.",
"E05_PAZCA_d083": "No, that's perfect. You're a natural.",
"E05_PAZCA_d084": "Really? Because I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.",
"E05_PAZCA_d085": "Trust me. Any guy would be lucky to have your attention.",
"E05_PAZCA_d086": "Shit, she's actually turning me on.",
"E05_PAZCA_d087": "What else do they like?",
"E05_PAZCA_d088": "That. Definitely that.",
"E05_PAZCA_d089": "Good to know I'm learning something useful.",
"E05_PAZCA_d090": "Paz, you're incredible. Don't let anyone make you think otherwise.",
"E05_PAZCA_d091": "Even you think so?",
"E05_PAZCA_d092": "Especially me.",
"E05_PAZCA_d093": "Fuck... she's amazing.",
"E05_PAZCA_d094": "So that's what all the fuss is about?",
"E05_PAZCA_d095": "Part of it. The physical stuff is easy.",
"E05_PAZCA_d096": "I think I'm starting to get it.",
"E05_PAZCA_d097": "Yeah, me too.",
"E05_PAZCA_d098": "Paz, I don't think this is smart. Could fuck up our partnership.",
"E05_PAZCA_d099": "Right. Of course. Forget I asked.",
"E05_PAZCA_d100": "It's not that I don't want to help—",
"E05_PAZCA_d101": "No, you're right. This was stupid.",
"E05_PAZCA_d102": "Look, there are other ways to handle Kimura.",
"E05_PAZCA_d103": "Like what? Tell him to mind his own business?",
"E05_PAZCA_d104": "Exactly. Your personal life isn't his concern.",
"E05_PAZCA_d105": "Easy for you to say. You're not the one living a lie.",
"E05_PAZCA_d106": "You're not living a lie. You're protecting yourself.",
"E05_PAZCA_d107": "Same fucking difference.",
"E05_PAZCA_d108": "If he keeps pushing, we'll deal with it together.",
"E05_PAZCA_d109": "Right. Partners.",
"E05_PAZCA_d110": "Fuck Kimura. You don't need to prove anything to anyone.",
"E05_PAZCA_d111": "That's easy to say when nobody's questioning you.",
"E05_PAZCA_d112": "Then stop answering. Tell him to mind his own damn business.",
"E05_PAZCA_d113": "You really think it's that simple?",
"E05_PAZCA_d114": "I think you're giving them too much power over who you are.",
"E05_PAZCA_d115": "Maybe you're right.",
"E05_PAZCA_d116": "You're tough as nails, Paz. Don't let some rookie punk make you doubt yourself.",
"E05_PAZCA_d117": "Thanks. I needed to hear that.",
"E05_PAZCA_d118": "Anytime, partner.",
"E05_PAZCA_d119": "You always know what to say.",
"E05_PAZCA_d120": "Thanks for... teaching me. I feel more confident now.",
"E05_PAZCA_d121": "You were amazing, Paz. Any guy would be lucky.",
"E05_PAZCA_d122": "Even you?",
"E05_PAZCA_d123": "Especially me.",
"E05_PAZCA_d124": "Thanks for being honest, even if it wasn't what I wanted to hear.",
"E05_PAZCA_d125": "I just don't want to mess up what we have.",
"E05_PAZCA_d126": "I get it. Professional boundaries and all that.",
"E05_PAZCA_d127": "It's not just professional. You mean too much to me to risk it.",
"E05_PAZCA_d128": "Thanks for reminding me I don't need to change for anyone.",
"E05_PAZCA_d129": "You're perfect as you are, Paz.",
"E05_PAZCA_d130": "Well, maybe not perfect, but I'm me.",
"E05_PAZCA_d131": "And that's enough.",
"E05_PAZCA_d132": "I should get going. Shift ends soon.",
"E05_PAZCA_d133": "Thanks for calling. And for taking that risk with the key.",
"E05_PAZCA_d134": "That's what partners do, right?",
"E05_PAZCA_d135": "Right.",
"E05_PAZCA_d136": "I'm gonna try to figure out what this key opens. I'll send you photos and whatever I find.",
"E05_PAZCA_d137": "Be careful with that. Don't do anything alone.",
"E05_PAZCA_d138": "Keep this between us?",
"E05_PAZCA_d139": "Of course.",
"E05_PAZCA_d140": "And [mc_name]? This call never happened, but... I'm glad it did.",
"E05_PAZCA_d141": "Me too.",
"E05_PAZCA_d142": "Give Elizabeth my best when she wakes up.",
"E05_PAZCA_d143": "Will do.",
"E05_PAZCA_d144": "And [mc_name]? Thanks for not making this weirder than it already was.",
"E05_PAZCA_d145": "Hey, we've been through worse shit than this.",
"E05_PAZCA_d146": "True. Give Elizabeth my best when she wakes up.",
"E05_PAZCA_d147": "Will do.",
"E05_PAZCA_d148": "You always know what to say to make me feel better.",
"E05_PAZCA_d149": "That's what friends are for.",
"E05_PAZCA_d150": "Give Elizabeth my best when she wakes up.",
"E05_PAZCA_d151": "Will do.",
"E05_PAZCA_d152": "Back to reality. At least that helped clear my head... in more ways than one.",
"E05_PAZCA_d153": "Back to reality. Probably made the right call there.",
"E05_PAZCA_d154": "Back to reality. Paz is stronger than she gives herself credit for.",
"E05_PAZCA_d155": "Better check on Elizabeth.",

"E05_AMBHO_d001": "What the hell? 'Roof. Now. Bring cigs.' That's random as fuck.",
"E05_AMBHO_d002": "Amber never asks me to meet her anywhere. What's this about?",
"E05_AMBHO_d003": "And why the roof?",
"E05_AMBHO_d004": "Jesus, Amber. You're sitting pretty close to the edge there.",
"E05_AMBHO_d005": "I like the view. You can see the whole city from up here.",
"E05_AMBHO_d006": "You can also see the ground. Very clearly. And it's very far down.",
"E05_AMBHO_d007": "Still scared of heights, I see.",
"E05_AMBHO_d008": "Some fears are rational. Like not wanting to fall off a hospital roof.",
"E05_AMBHO_d009": "Some fears are just excuses to avoid shit.",
"E05_AMBHO_d010": "Managed to steal those from the doctor's lounge?",
"E05_AMBHO_d011": "Yeah. Figured you'd need them for whatever this is about.",
"E05_AMBHO_d012": "Look at you, breaking rules now.",
"E05_AMBHO_d013": "You're rubbing off on me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d014": "In more ways than one, hopefully.",
"E05_AMBHO_d015": "Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d016": "So, Mom tried to kill herself. Let's start there.",
"E05_AMBHO_d017": "The doctors didn't exactly say—",
"E05_AMBHO_d018": "They wouldn't. But I can tell.",
"E05_AMBHO_d019": "Broken mirror, slashed wrists that barely missed the arteries...",
"E05_AMBHO_d020": "Classic cry for help, not a real attempt.",
"E05_AMBHO_d021": "How would you know that?",
"E05_AMBHO_d022": "Three times. That's my record.",
"E05_AMBHO_d023": "First was pills. Second was cutting – obviously fucked that up.",
"E05_AMBHO_d024": "Third time was more... creative.",
"E05_AMBHO_d025": "Shit, Amber. I had no idea.",
"E05_AMBHO_d026": "Why would you? You were already gone. Osaka and your police thing.",
"E05_AMBHO_d027": "I should have been here.",
"E05_AMBHO_d028": "Should have, could have, whatever. Past is past.",
"E05_AMBHO_d029": "I'm sorry...",
"E05_AMBHO_d030": "Yeah, whatever.",
"E05_AMBHO_d031": "That explains some things about you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d032": "Wow. Thanks for the sympathy.",
"E05_AMBHO_d033": "I didn't mean it like that.",
"E05_AMBHO_d034": "Sure you didn't. Always so fucking emotionally available, aren't you?",
"E05_AMBHO_d035": "That's not fair.",
"E05_AMBHO_d036": "Life's not fair. Deal with it.",
"E05_AMBHO_d037": "Want to know why I never called you during any of those times?",
"E05_AMBHO_d038": "Tell me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d039": "What was I gonna say? 'Hey [mc_name], remember when I told you I loved you and you basically ran away? Well, now I'm dying about it'?",
"E05_AMBHO_d040": "You want to know why I never called you during my little episodes?",
"E05_AMBHO_d041": "Sure.",
"E05_AMBHO_d042": "Because I knew you'd react exactly like this. Cold as fuck.",
"E05_AMBHO_d043": "I'm not being cold.",
"E05_AMBHO_d044": "Right. Sure.",
"E05_AMBHO_d045": "I'm sorry. For not being there.",
"E05_AMBHO_d046": "Sure, why not—one more apology to add to the collection.",
"E05_AMBHO_d047": "But is it really?",
"E05_AMBHO_d048": "We've been dancing around each other since I got back.",
"E05_AMBHO_d049": "Have we?",
"E05_AMBHO_d050": "Don't play dumb. The tension, the looks...",
"E05_AMBHO_d051": "Maybe that's safer.",
"E05_AMBHO_d052": "Safer for who? Because it's driving me crazy.",
"E05_AMBHO_d053": "What do you want me to say, Amber?",
"E05_AMBHO_d054": "I want you to be honest. About what you feel when you look at me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d055": "Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d056": "I thought you'd understand. That you'd see I'm not a kid anymore.",
"E05_AMBHO_d057": "I see that. That's the problem.",
"E05_AMBHO_d058": "Why is it a problem? Because we're related? Because of what people might think?",
"E05_AMBHO_d059": "Because I don't have protection. Because this could lead somewhere we can't take back.",
"E05_AMBHO_d060": "That day, in the kitchen. We need to talk about it.",
"E05_AMBHO_d061": "What about it?",
"E05_AMBHO_d062": "You didn't wear a condom.",
"E05_AMBHO_d063": "No, I didn't.",
"E05_AMBHO_d064": "I thought you'd understand what it meant when I let that happen without protection.",
"E05_AMBHO_d065": "But that's exactly why we should have used it.",
"E05_AMBHO_d066": "You know why part of me was terrified about not being careful?",
"E05_AMBHO_d067": "Because you were being responsible?",
"E05_AMBHO_d068": "Because I was fucking terrified.",
"E05_AMBHO_d069": "Not of getting pregnant or whatever excuse I gave you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d070": "Then what?",
"E05_AMBHO_d071": "Of how much I wanted it. How much I wanted you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d072": "I'd spent years building this wall around myself.",
"E05_AMBHO_d073": "The whole goth metalhead thing?",
"E05_AMBHO_d074": "Yeah. The girl who doesn't give a fuck about anything.",
"E05_AMBHO_d075": "But with you... I was just Amber again. That pathetic little girl who followed you around.",
"E05_AMBHO_d076": "You weren't pathetic.",
"E05_AMBHO_d077": "I was weak. Needy. Everything I swore I'd never be again.",
"E05_AMBHO_d078": "You know what it was like after you left? Dad got more controlling, the house got quieter...",
"E05_AMBHO_d079": "I was young, watching everything fall apart, and the one person who made me feel safe was gone.",
"E05_AMBHO_d080": "I didn't know it was that bad.",
"E05_AMBHO_d081": "Of course you didn't. You had your new life.",
"E05_AMBHO_d082": "So I built something for myself. My streams, my fans, my own thing.",
"E05_AMBHO_d083": "I never really understood what you were going through.",
"E05_AMBHO_d084": "No shit. You see the black hair and tattoos and think you know me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d085": "So tell me. Help me understand.",
"E05_AMBHO_d086": "Most days it doesn't feel real. Just another performance.",
"E05_AMBHO_d087": "But sometimes... sometimes I remember what it felt like to just be me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d088": "And back then?",
"E05_AMBHO_d089": "Back then my brain actually shut up for once.",
"E05_AMBHO_d090": "And now?",
"E05_AMBHO_d091": "Now I'm thinking too much again.",
"E05_AMBHO_d092": "Before, it was just... instinct. Pure need.",
"E05_AMBHO_d093": "Ouch. Thanks for the shove... so, what about now?",
"E05_AMBHO_d094": "Right now it would be a choice.",
"E05_AMBHO_d095": "She's giving me an out. Or an in.",
"E05_AMBHO_d096": "Do I want this? Do I want her?",
"E05_AMBHO_d097": "Fuck, of course I do. I always have.",
"E05_AMBHO_d098": "I want to make that choice. But I want to do this right.",
"E05_AMBHO_d099": "What does 'right' mean?",
"E05_AMBHO_d100": "It means taking our time. It means this isn't just about sex.",
"E05_AMBHO_d101": "You want to go slow?",
"E05_AMBHO_d102": "I want to make sure you know how much you mean to me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d103": "God, you're going to make me cry.",
"E05_AMBHO_d104": "Good tears or bad tears?",
"E05_AMBHO_d105": "Good tears, you idiot.",
"E05_AMBHO_d106": "Fuck being careful. I want you. Right here, right now.",
"E05_AMBHO_d107": "Even if someone could see us?",
"E05_AMBHO_d108": "I don't care who sees. I'm tired of hiding how I feel.",
"E05_AMBHO_d109": "And how do you feel?",
"E05_AMBHO_d110": "Like I'm going crazy without you. Like I need you more than air.",
"E05_AMBHO_d111": "Then take me. Stop thinking and just take what you want.",
"E05_AMBHO_d112": "You sure you can handle that?",
"E05_AMBHO_d113": "Try me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d114": "Maybe we should head back. It's getting cold.",
"E05_AMBHO_d115": "Right. Forgot who I was talking to.",
"E05_AMBHO_d116": "Mr. Run Away when things get real.",
"E05_AMBHO_d117": "Amber, that's not—",
"E05_AMBHO_d118": "Save it. I'm going home to stream. Have fun with Elizabeth.",
"E05_AMBHO_d119": "At least she's too drugged up to reject you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d120": "I need you to know something before we do this.",
"E05_AMBHO_d121": "What?",
"E05_AMBHO_d122": "I'm not on anything. No pill, no protection. And I don't care.",
"E05_AMBHO_d123": "Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d124": "That's how much I trust you. How much I want this to matter.",
"E05_AMBHO_d125": "Are you sure?",
"E05_AMBHO_d126": "More sure than I've been about anything.",
"E05_AMBHO_d127": "Look at me. Really look...",
"E05_AMBHO_d128": "I'm looking.",
"E05_AMBHO_d129": "See past all the bullshit?",
"E05_AMBHO_d130": "I see you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d131": "Then touch me like you mean it...",
"E05_AMBHO_d132": "Fuck. There's no going back after this.",
"E05_AMBHO_d133": "But I don't want to go back.",
"E05_AMBHO_d134": "I used to imagine this. Us...",
"E05_AMBHO_d135": "Yeah?",
"E05_AMBHO_d136": "Stupid fantasies. But now...",
"E05_AMBHO_d137": "Now it's real.",
"E05_AMBHO_d138": "Are you nervous?",
"E05_AMBHO_d139": "Scared shitless.",
"E05_AMBHO_d140": "Good... mmm... feel something with me...",
"E05_AMBHO_d141": "I always felt something... that was the problem...",
"E05_AMBHO_d142": "And now?",
"E05_AMBHO_d143": "Now I don't want to fight it...",
"E05_AMBHO_d144": "Then don't...",
"E05_AMBHO_d145": "She tastes like cigarettes and rebellion.",
"E05_AMBHO_d146": "And I can't get enough.",
"E05_AMBHO_d147": "You're beautiful...",
"E05_AMBHO_d148": "Don't lie to me. Not now...",
"E05_AMBHO_d149": "I'm not lying.",
"E05_AMBHO_d150": "Even with all my damage?",
"E05_AMBHO_d151": "Especially with it...",
"E05_AMBHO_d152": "Good answer...",
"E05_AMBHO_d153": "God... your hands... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d154": "Tell me what you want... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d155": "Everything. All of you... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d156": "You have me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d157": "Do I? Really? Mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d158": "Yes... fuck, yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d159": "Promise me something... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d160": "What?",
"E05_AMBHO_d161": "Don't think about her while you're with me... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d162": "Who?",
"E05_AMBHO_d163": "Don't play dumb. Antonella... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d164": "Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d165": "I need to know I'm enough. That I'm here, I'm real... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d166": "I've been competing with a ghost...",
"E05_AMBHO_d167": "You're not competing with anyone...",
"E05_AMBHO_d168": "Aren't I?",
"E05_AMBHO_d169": "Right now, there's only you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d170": "Prove it...",
"E05_AMBHO_d171": "She needs this. Needs to know she matters.",
"E05_AMBHO_d172": "Let me take care of you first...",
"E05_AMBHO_d173": "You don't have to—",
"E05_AMBHO_d174": "I want to...",
"E05_AMBHO_d175": "Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d176": "Shut up and let me...",
"E05_AMBHO_d177": "The way she's looking at me... like I'm everything.",
"E05_AMBHO_d178": "You're shaking...",
"E05_AMBHO_d179": "Cold...",
"E05_AMBHO_d180": "Liar. You're nervous...",
"E05_AMBHO_d181": "Maybe.",
"E05_AMBHO_d182": "Don't be. It's just me... mmmm... God, you're so hard...",
"E05_AMBHO_d183": "That's exactly why I'm nervous... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d184": "I love you. I've always loved you...",
"E05_AMBHO_d185": "Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d186": "Say it back...",
"E05_AMBHO_d187": "I love you too.",
"E05_AMBHO_d188": "Even though we're fucked up?...",
"E05_AMBHO_d189": "Because we're fucked up...",
"E05_AMBHO_d190": "I need you inside me... now...",
"E05_AMBHO_d191": "Are you ready?",
"E05_AMBHO_d192": "I've been ready for years...",
"E05_AMBHO_d193": "This is it. No more running.",
"E05_AMBHO_d194": "Just us.",
"E05_AMBHO_d195": "Oh god... [mc_name]... yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d196": "You okay?",
"E05_AMBHO_d197": "Perfect. So fucking perfect... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d198": "You feel...",
"E05_AMBHO_d199": "Like we were made for this... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d200": "God, Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d201": "Move. Please move... deeper...",
"E05_AMBHO_d202": "Mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d203": "Ahhh... fuck yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d204": "She's so tight, so warm... fuck.",
"E05_AMBHO_d205": "The sounds she's making... driving me crazy.",
"E05_AMBHO_d206": "Harder. I won't break... ahhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d207": "You sure? Ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d208": "I'm sure. I want to feel you for days... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d209": "Fuck, Amber... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d210": "That's it. Lose control... ohhh... yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d211": "Look at me while you fuck me... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d212": "I'm looking... mmm... you're so beautiful...",
"E05_AMBHO_d213": "See me. Not her. Me... ohhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d214": "I see you. Only you... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d215": "Good. Because I'm the one here... mmmm... the one taking your cock...",
"E05_AMBHO_d216": "You're the one I want... God, Amber...",
"E05_AMBHO_d217": "Why did you choose her over me? Ahhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d218": "Amber, not now— ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d219": "Yes, now. While you're inside me... mmmm... why wasn't I enough?",
"E05_AMBHO_d220": "You were enough... ahhh... you were too much...",
"E05_AMBHO_d221": "What does that mean? Ohhh... harder...",
"E05_AMBHO_d222": "It means you scared me... mmm... because I wanted you so badly...",
"E05_AMBHO_d223": "And she didn't scare you? Ahhh... fuck yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d224": "She was safe... ohhh... you were everything...",
"E05_AMBHO_d225": "Am I still everything? Mmmm... God, yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d226": "More than everything... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d227": "Then prove it... ohhh... make me forget every night I cried... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d228": "I will... fuck, I will...",
"E05_AMBHO_d229": "I used to touch myself thinking about this... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d230": "Yeah? Mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d231": "Every night after you left... ohhh... imagining you coming back...",
"E05_AMBHO_d232": "I should have... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d233": "You're here now... mmmm... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d234": "The way she moves... like she's trying to get closer than possible.",
"E05_AMBHO_d235": "I love how you feel inside me... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d236": "I love being inside you... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d237": "Better than her? Ahhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d238": "There is no comparison... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d239": "Good answer... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d240": "It's the truth... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d241": "I want to ride you... ohhh... show you what you missed...",
"E05_AMBHO_d242": "Show me... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d243": "Watch my face while I take what's mine... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d244": "You're so fucking beautiful like this... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d245": "Like what? Mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d246": "Wild. Free. Mine... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d247": "Tell me I'm better than your fantasies... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d248": "You're destroying every fantasy I ever had... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d249": "Good. I want to be the only thing you think about... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d250": "You already are... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d251": "Even in Tokyo? Ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d252": "Especially in Tokyo... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d253": "God, you're so deep... ohhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d254": "Is it too much? Ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d255": "It's perfect. You're perfect... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d256": "So are you... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d257": "We're perfect together... ahhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d258": "Always have been... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d259": "I'm going to cum... ahhh... are you close?",
"E05_AMBHO_d260": "Getting there... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d261": "Cum with me. I want us to cum together... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d262": "Amber... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d263": "Please. Make this perfect... ahhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d264": "From behind. I want to feel you deeper... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d265": "Like this? Mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d266": "Exactly like that... ahhh... fuck yes...",
"E05_AMBHO_d267": "She's incredible. How did I resist this?",
"E05_AMBHO_d268": "You feel even bigger this way... ohhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d269": "You feel even tighter... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d270": "Don't stop. Please don't stop... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d271": "I won't...",
"E05_AMBHO_d272": "I never want this to end... ",
"E05_AMBHO_d273": "Neither do I...",
"E05_AMBHO_d274": "Then don't let it... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d275": "I won't...",
"E05_AMBHO_d276": "Touch me. Touch all of me... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d277": "Where? Mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d278": "Everywhere... ahhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d279": "Like this? Ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d280": "Yes... God, yes... mmmm... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d281": "She's so responsive. Every touch makes her shiver.",
"E05_AMBHO_d282": "I'm so close, [mc_name]. So fucking close... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d283": "Let go. I've got you... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d284": "Promise you won't leave after? Ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d285": "I promise... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d286": "Then make me yours... ahhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d287": "You already are mine... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d288": "Harder. I can take it... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d289": "You sure? Mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d290": "I'm sure... ohhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d291": "Fuck, Amber... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d292": "That's it. Use me... mmmm... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d293": "I need you... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d294": "Did she ever let you do this? Ahhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d295": "Amber, please— mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d296": "Answer me. While you're fucking me... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d297": "No. Never like this... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d298": "Good. This is ours... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d299": "Only ours... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d300": "I'm going to come, [mc_name]... ahhh... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d301": "Me too. Fuck, me too... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d302": "Inside me. Come inside me... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d303": "Are you sure? Ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d304": "I've never been more sure... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d305": "Amber... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d306": "Now, [mc_name]. Come with me now... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d307": "Amber! Not yet... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d308": "Yes! God, yes... mmmm... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d309": "She's perfect. Absolutely perfect.",
"E05_AMBHO_d310": "How did I live without this?",
"E05_AMBHO_d311": "Don't stop. Keep going... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d312": "I can't... I'm coming... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d313": "I can feel you... mmmm... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d314": "Amber... fuck... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d315": "Give me everything... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d316": "I love you... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d317": "I want more. I want all of you... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d318": "You have all of me... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d319": "Do I? Even the parts you gave to her? Mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d320": "There are no parts left for anyone else... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d321": "Promise me... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d322": "I promise... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d323": "Inside. Please... ahhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d324": "Are you sure? Ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d325": "I've never been more sure... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d326": "This is it. Everything's changing.",
"E05_AMBHO_d327": "And I want it to change.",
"E05_AMBHO_d328": "Yes... fill me up... ahhh... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d329": "Amber... I'm coming... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d330": "I can feel you. So warm... ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d331": "God, I love you... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d332": "I love you too... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d333": "This is perfect. She's perfect.",
"E05_AMBHO_d334": "Don't pull out yet. Stay with me... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d335": "As long as you want... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d336": "Forever? Ahhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d337": "If that's what you want... fuck...",
"E05_AMBHO_d338": "It is... mmmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d339": "Then forever it is... ohhh...",
"E05_AMBHO_d340": "That was... mmm...",
"E05_AMBHO_d341": "Yeah.",
"E05_AMBHO_d342": "Better than I imagined. And I imagined it a lot.",
"E05_AMBHO_d343": "Me too.",
"E05_AMBHO_d344": "Really? You thought about me?",
"E05_AMBHO_d345": "More than I should have.",
"E05_AMBHO_d346": "No regrets?",
"E05_AMBHO_d347": "None. You?",
"E05_AMBHO_d348": "Just one.",
"E05_AMBHO_d349": "What's that?",
"E05_AMBHO_d350": "That we waited so long.",
"E05_AMBHO_d351": "Waited for what?",
"E05_AMBHO_d352": "For you to cum inside me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d353": "You're absolutely nuts—but kinda charming.",
"E05_AMBHO_d354": "You think so?",
"E05_AMBHO_d355": "I know so.",
"E05_AMBHO_d356": "We should clean up before going back.",
"E05_AMBHO_d357": "Probably.",
"E05_AMBHO_d358": "This isn't just sex for me.",
"E05_AMBHO_d359": "I know. It's not for me either.",
"E05_AMBHO_d360": "Good. Because I can't do casual. Not with you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d361": "I don't want casual either.",
"E05_AMBHO_d362": "What do you want?",
"E05_AMBHO_d363": "You. All of you.",
"E05_AMBHO_d364": "I used to dream about moments like this.",
"E05_AMBHO_d365": "Just holding each other?",
"E05_AMBHO_d366": "Being yours. Really yours.",
"E05_AMBHO_d367": "You are mine. You always have been.",
"E05_AMBHO_d368": "Even when you were with her?",
"E05_AMBHO_d369": "Especially then.",
"E05_AMBHO_d370": "I'm scared.",
"E05_AMBHO_d371": "Of what?",
"E05_AMBHO_d372": "That this is too good to be real. That I'll wake up and you'll be gone again.",
"E05_AMBHO_d373": "I'm not going anywhere.",
"E05_AMBHO_d374": "You said that before.",
"E05_AMBHO_d375": "This time is different.",
"E05_AMBHO_d376": "How?",
"E05_AMBHO_d377": "Because this time, I'm choosing to stay.",
"E05_AMBHO_d378": "Shit, I need to check my stream schedule.",
"E05_AMBHO_d379": "Right now?",
"E05_AMBHO_d380": "Sorry, but AmberDark has commitments. Even if Amber just had the best sex of her life.",
"E05_AMBHO_d381": "How do you switch like that?",
"E05_AMBHO_d382": "Practice. And compartmentalization.",
"E05_AMBHO_d383": "Stream starts in forty minutes.",
"E05_AMBHO_d384": "Come here.",
"E05_AMBHO_d385": "What?",
"E05_AMBHO_d386": "I want to say goodbye properly. Not just 'see you at home.'",
"E05_AMBHO_d387": "We do live together.",
"E05_AMBHO_d388": "Exactly. Which makes this complicated.",
"E05_AMBHO_d389": "Promise we won't make breakfast weird.",
"E05_AMBHO_d390": "Define weird.",
"E05_AMBHO_d391": "No awkward avoiding, no pretending this didn't happen.",
"E05_AMBHO_d392": "What do you want it to be?",
"E05_AMBHO_d393": "I want us to figure it out. No pressure.",
"E05_AMBHO_d394": "Us?",
"E05_AMBHO_d395": "Yeah, us. Like it should have been.",
"E05_AMBHO_d396": "Now go check on Mom. I need to get home for my stream.",
"E05_AMBHO_d397": "And [mc_name]?",
"E05_AMBHO_d398": "Yeah?",
"E05_AMBHO_d399": "Next time, let's find somewhere with a bed. This concrete sucks.",
"E05_AMBHO_d400": "Next time?",
"E05_AMBHO_d401": "Oh, there's definitely going to be a next time.",
"E05_AMBHO_d402": "I'll hold you to that.",
"E05_AMBHO_d403": "You better.",

"E05_ELIDR_d001": "There's my sweet boy...",
"E05_ELIDR_d002": "You stayed with me all night, didn't you?",
"E05_ELIDR_d003": "Always there when mommy needs you most.",
"E05_ELIDR_d004": "He's with me. School holiday.",
"E05_ELIDR_d005": "My son stays where I want him.",
"E05_ELIDR_d006": "Everyone's staring at Mom's dress... you can see everything through it.",
"E05_ELIDR_d007": "Sorry about dragging you to another boring shoot, baby.",
"E05_ELIDR_d008": "It's cool, Mom. I kinda like seeing you do your thing.",
"E05_ELIDR_d009": "You're so sweet to say that, sweetheart.",
"E05_ELIDR_d010": "She smiled like... really smiled. Like she's glad I'm here.",
"E05_ELIDR_d011": "Honestly? Way better than hanging out alone at home.",
"E05_ELIDR_d012": "At least someone appreciates my company.",
"E05_ELIDR_d013": "She sounded kinda down... maybe I should've been more into it.",
"E05_ELIDR_d014": "It's cool—I don't really mind hanging around.",
"E05_ELIDR_d015": "Such a patient boy... sometimes too patient.",
"E05_ELIDR_d016": "Why'd she sound so let down? What was I supposed to say?",
"E05_ELIDR_d017": "Your father's always at that damn hospital anyway.",
"E05_ELIDR_d018": "Shit, that dress is way too tight... I really shouldn't be looking.",
"E05_ELIDR_d019": "Dude, she's my mom... why the hell am I even thinking this?",
"E05_ELIDR_d020": "Jesus, Mom looks... fuck, that dress doesn't hide anything.",
"E05_ELIDR_d021": "Oh fuck, I can totally see... through that thing.",
"E05_ELIDR_d022": "Okay, just focus on the cameras and shit.",
"E05_ELIDR_d023": "Stop thinking about it, man. Just... don't.",
"E05_ELIDR_d024": "You're the only man who never disappoints me, you know that?",
"E05_ELIDR_d025": "Daddy makes promises he breaks, but not my boy.",
"E05_ELIDR_d026": "Yeah, I'll stick around for you, Mom.",
"E05_ELIDR_d027": "Always? That's a big promise, sweetheart.",
"E05_ELIDR_d028": "But I believe you mean it.",
"E05_ELIDR_d029": "The way she's looking at me... it's kinda different than how she looks at Dad.",
"E05_ELIDR_d030": "I try not to mess things up, you know?",
"E05_ELIDR_d031": "You never could, baby. You're perfect just as you are.",
"E05_ELIDR_d032": "Perfect? I mean... that's still kinda a lot to live up to.",
"E05_ELIDR_d033": "That's just what family does, right?",
"E05_ELIDR_d034": "Family... yes, I suppose that's what we are.",
"E05_ELIDR_d035": "She sounded kinda bummed when I said 'family'... did I say something wrong?",
"E05_ELIDR_d036": "Wait for me at the hotel hall, sweetheart.",
"E05_ELIDR_d037": "They want me for another shoot after this one.",
"E05_ELIDR_d038": "I need you to wait a little longer, baby. Can you do that for mommy?",
"E05_ELIDR_d039": "How long you gonna be?",
"E05_ELIDR_d040": "Just a few hours. Stay in the hotel where it's safe.",
"E05_ELIDR_d041": "She never came back... it's been forever.",
"E05_ELIDR_d042": "Maybe she's in her room? The door's kinda open...",
"E05_ELIDR_d043": "Mom? You in there?",
"E05_ELIDR_d044": "Oh fuck... I gotta get out of here right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d045": "This is so messed up, like really fucking wrong.",
"E05_ELIDR_d046": "What's she doing? Maybe I should check if she's okay or something.",
"E05_ELIDR_d047": "What if she's hurt or sick ?",
"E05_ELIDR_d048": "If I just back away real quiet, she won't even know I was here.",
"E05_ELIDR_d049": "Yeah, better to just avoid this whole mess.",
"E05_ELIDR_d050": "Don't leave me... not tonight...",
"E05_ELIDR_d051": "Everyone always leaves when I need them...",
"E05_ELIDR_d052": "Someone stay with me... please...",
"E05_ELIDR_d053": "She's like, really wasted... I probably shouldn't be here.",
"E05_ELIDR_d054": "But I can't just ditch her like this, right?",
"E05_ELIDR_d055": "She looks kinda... I don't know, vulnerable or whatever.",
"E05_ELIDR_d056": "Maybe this is like, what she needs or something?",
"E05_ELIDR_d057": "This is way too much... I gotta think about something else.",
"E05_ELIDR_d058": "Maybe I should call Dad.",
"E05_ELIDR_d059": "I don't even know what I'm feeling right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d060": "Like, part of me wants to help, but part of me just wants to get out of here.",
"E05_ELIDR_d061": "So fucking empty... this room, this life...",
"E05_ELIDR_d062": "Nothing but cameras and fake smiles...",
"E05_ELIDR_d063": "Need to feel something real... mmm...",
"E05_ELIDR_d064": "She's... doing stuff... I should probably leave but...",
"E05_ELIDR_d065": "What if she like, hurts herself or something? She's totally wasted.",
"E05_ELIDR_d066": "She's... doing that... and it's kinda hot.",
"E05_ELIDR_d067": "I've never seen... like, anything like this before.",
"E05_ELIDR_d068": "She needs help but like, not from me.",
"E05_ELIDR_d069": "This is way beyond what I should be dealing with.",
"E05_ELIDR_d070": "This is so messed up... I have no idea what to do.",
"E05_ELIDR_d071": "Should I stay or just... get out of here?",
"E05_ELIDR_d072": "All these men... they look but never see...",
"E05_ELIDR_d073": "Never stay... never love the broken parts... ahh...",
"E05_ELIDR_d074": "But my boy... mmm... he sees everything...",
"E05_ELIDR_d075": "Sees mommy when she's not performing... ooh...",
"E05_ELIDR_d076": "Always alone when the lights go down... ahh...",
"E05_ELIDR_d077": "They want the fantasy, not the woman...",
"E05_ELIDR_d078": "My sweet boy... ooh... the only one who sees me...",
"E05_ELIDR_d079": "This is making me feel sick, but I can't just bail on her.",
"E05_ELIDR_d080": "What's she even need right now?",
"E05_ELIDR_d081": "I don't get why I'm even thinking about that.",
"E05_ELIDR_d082": "She looks... kinda perfect like this.",
"E05_ELIDR_d083": "What's she even mean by that?",
"E05_ELIDR_d084": "Maybe it's just the booze talking.",
"E05_ELIDR_d085": "This is so weird... like, is she hurt or something?",
"E05_ELIDR_d086": "I have no clue what I'm even feeling right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d087": "[mc_name]... mmm... you never leave mommy...",
"E05_ELIDR_d088": "The only man who stays... ahh... who cares...",
"E05_ELIDR_d089": "I wanna tell her I'm here, that I'll like, always be around for her.",
"E05_ELIDR_d090": "She's saying my name while she's... oh shit.",
"E05_ELIDR_d091": "She's saying my name while she's... this is so fucked up.",
"E05_ELIDR_d092": "I really shouldn't be hearing this, but I can't like... move.",
"E05_ELIDR_d093": "I can't encourage this shit but I can't stop it either.",
"E05_ELIDR_d094": "Maybe if I just stay super quiet and don't move...",
"E05_ELIDR_d095": "Even when I'm alone... you're still with me... ooh...",
"E05_ELIDR_d096": "She's thinking about me while she's... shit, that's messed up.",
"E05_ELIDR_d097": "This is like, really weird but she's hurting.",
"E05_ELIDR_d098": "She's actually thinking about me... like, saying my name and stuff.",
"E05_ELIDR_d099": "Maybe we've got something kinda special going on?",
"E05_ELIDR_d100": "She probably doesn't actually mean me though.",
"E05_ELIDR_d101": "She's just like, confused and wasted.",
"E05_ELIDR_d102": "I'm so lost... like, is this bad or what?",
"E05_ELIDR_d103": "My body's doing one thing but my brain's like freaking out.",
"E05_ELIDR_d104": "This body... mmm... it's all I have to offer...",
"E05_ELIDR_d105": "But he loves me for more... ahh... loves broken mommy...",
"E05_ELIDR_d106": "Not like the others... ooh... who take and leave...",
"E05_ELIDR_d107": "He stays... even when I'm ugly inside... mmm...",
"E05_ELIDR_d108": "So tired of being used... ooh... want to be loved...",
"E05_ELIDR_d109": "My beautiful boy would never hurt me... mmm...",
"E05_ELIDR_d110": "I mean, yeah I love her... but not like, in that way.",
"E05_ELIDR_d111": "She's getting stuff mixed up, like different types of love.",
"E05_ELIDR_d112": "I do care about her... all the messed up parts too.",
"E05_ELIDR_d113": "Maybe I can just be whatever she needs, you know?",
"E05_ELIDR_d114": "I love her 'cause she's my mom, that's it.",
"E05_ELIDR_d115": "This'll probably seem super weird tomorrow.",
"E05_ELIDR_d116": "The way she talks about love... it's kinda desperate, man.",
"E05_ELIDR_d117": "Maybe she needs something I can't really give her.",
"E05_ELIDR_d118": "Someone who stays... ahh... who loves all of me...",
"E05_ELIDR_d119": "Not just the pretty parts... mmm... the broken parts too...",
"E05_ELIDR_d120": "Come closer, baby... ooh... don't be scared...",
"E05_ELIDR_d121": "Mommy needs you... ahh... needs to feel wanted...",
"E05_ELIDR_d122": "Does she know I'm here? She's been like, talking to me this whole time.",
"E05_ELIDR_d123": "This is so messed up but she's like, really hurting right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d124": "Does she know I'm here? Kinda seems like she wants me to come closer.",
"E05_ELIDR_d125": "Maybe I should... I dunno, maybe she needs this or something.",
"E05_ELIDR_d126": "I should just look at the window... the city lights and stuff.",
"E05_ELIDR_d127": "Anything but whatever she's doing right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d128": "Part of me wants to go closer, part of me just wants to bail.",
"E05_ELIDR_d129": "I'm so fucking confused right now, man.",
"E05_ELIDR_d130": "See what desire looks like without the costume?",
"E05_ELIDR_d131": "Raw and desperate and real...",
"E05_ELIDR_d132": "I probably shouldn't be seeing this... like, I'm her son.",
"E05_ELIDR_d133": "But maybe she's showing me 'cause she actually trusts me or something.",
"E05_ELIDR_d134": "She's letting me see stuff that nobody else gets to see.",
"E05_ELIDR_d135": "Man... this is kinda special, I guess.",
"E05_ELIDR_d136": "I mean, I'm not really looking at anything specific.",
"E05_ELIDR_d137": "Just some drunk lady having a meltdown.",
"E05_ELIDR_d138": "This is like, beautiful but also really messed up.",
"E05_ELIDR_d139": "I have no clue what this even means.",
"E05_ELIDR_d140": "This is what your mommy really is underneath...",
"E05_ELIDR_d141": "Not the perfect image... just a woman who needs...",
"E05_ELIDR_d142": "You don't have to hide anymore, darling...",
"E05_ELIDR_d143": "I'm not mad, not even close. Come here, baby.",
"E05_ELIDR_d144": "Come out of hiding, love—it's just us now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d145": "It's alright, I promise. Just come to me, love.",
"E05_ELIDR_d146": "No need to stay in the shadows, sweetheart...",
"E05_ELIDR_d147": "There's no anger here—just me, waiting for you.",
"E05_ELIDR_d148": "No need to keep hiding, love. You're safe with me.",
"E05_ELIDR_d149": "There's nothing to fear, love. Just come to me.",
"E05_ELIDR_d150": "This never happened, you understand me? Never.",
"E05_ELIDR_d151": "The world isn't ready for love this complicated.",
"E05_ELIDR_d152": "You don't need to understand, baby. Just forget.",
"E05_ELIDR_d153": "Mom, this is like... really messed up...",
"E05_ELIDR_d154": "You're kinda wasted and not thinking straight.",
"E05_ELIDR_d155": "Yeah, I get it. Won't say anything.",
"E05_ELIDR_d156": "I mean, nobody else needs to know about this stuff anyway.",
"E05_ELIDR_d157": "Yeah, sure. Whatever you want, I guess.",
"E05_ELIDR_d158": "I'll just act like this never happened.",
"E05_ELIDR_d159": "I honestly have no clue what to say right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d160": "This whole thing is like, really confusing.",
"E05_ELIDR_d161": "Good boy. Always such a good boy for mommy.",
"E05_ELIDR_d162": "Some things are better left as dreams, sweetheart.",
"E05_ELIDR_d163": "She looks amazing... like, seriously beautiful.",
"E05_ELIDR_d164": "I just wanna be close to her, y'know? Like, make her feel okay.",
"E05_ELIDR_d165": "Maybe this kinda stuff actually happens for real.",
"E05_ELIDR_d166": "I feel guilty, yeah. But she's still crazy beautiful.",
"E05_ELIDR_d167": "I swear, I won't be able to get that outta my head.",
"E05_ELIDR_d168": "I'm legit trying not to stare... but she's right there.",
"E05_ELIDR_d169": "Okay but seriously... How do I erase that from my brain?",
"E05_ELIDR_d170": "Good boy. Always such a good boy for mommy.",
"E05_ELIDR_d171": "Some things are better left as dreams, sweetheart.",
"E05_ELIDR_d172": "Yeah, she's right... this stuff needs to stay in dreamland.",
"E05_ELIDR_d173": "But like, seeing her hurt this bad really sucks.",
"E05_ELIDR_d174": "Way better as dreams. Or like, nightmares, whatever.",
"E05_ELIDR_d175": "I just wanna go home and forget this whole mess.",
"E05_ELIDR_d176": "I don't even know what to think anymore, man.",
"E05_ELIDR_d177": "Everything's just so messed up and confusing.",
"E05_ELIDR_d178": "Come here, let mommy hold you.",
"E05_ELIDR_d179": "You're shaking, sweet boy.",
"E05_ELIDR_d180": "I'm not freaked out or anything... just kinda confused and feel bad about it.",
"E05_ELIDR_d181": "This is messed up but like... I can't just ditch her.",
"E05_ELIDR_d182": "I'm not scared or whatever... just feeling some weird new stuff.",
"E05_ELIDR_d183": "Being this close to her is like... I don't know, intense or something.",
"E05_ELIDR_d184": "I'm good, Mom. Just beat, you know?",
"E05_ELIDR_d185": "Can't wait for this to be over.",

"E05_ELIDR_d187": "I have no clue what's going on with me right now.",
"E05_ELIDR_d188": "Confusion is normal when you see something beautiful.",
"E05_ELIDR_d189": "Your heart's racing... mine too.",
"E05_ELIDR_d190": "My heart's going crazy but it's just guilt, not like... excitement.",
"E05_ELIDR_d191": "But her skin's so warm though...",
"E05_ELIDR_d192": "Her skin's so warm... and she's like, barely wearing anything.",
"E05_ELIDR_d193": "I kinda want to touch her... like, to help.",
"E05_ELIDR_d194": "I just want this whole thing to be done.",
"E05_ELIDR_d195": "Tomorrow we'll probably just pretend this never happened.",
"E05_ELIDR_d196": "My heart's going crazy... but I don't even know why.",
"E05_ELIDR_d197": "Fear? Like, excitement? Guilt? All that shit?",
"E05_ELIDR_d198": "The world doesn't understand connections like ours.",
"E05_ELIDR_d199": "They see wrong where there's only love.",
"E05_ELIDR_d200": "What are you saying, Mom?",
"E05_ELIDR_d201": "I'm saying you're the only person who's never left me, baby.",
"E05_ELIDR_d202": "And maybe that means something more than they'd approve of.",
"E05_ELIDR_d203": "But their approval never kept anyone warm at night.",
"E05_ELIDR_d204": "This feels like I'm crossing some line I probably shouldn't.",
"E05_ELIDR_d205": "But she needs someone... like, anyone.",
"E05_ELIDR_d206": "Maybe some lines are like, meant to be crossed.",
"E05_ELIDR_d207": "Maybe this is just natural between us or something.",
"E05_ELIDR_d208": "I'm not crossing any lines. This is just talking.",
"E05_ELIDR_d209": "Just drunk, confused talking.",
"E05_ELIDR_d210": "I don't even know where the lines are anymore.",
"E05_ELIDR_d211": "Everything feels kinda blurry and messed up.",
"E05_ELIDR_d212": "I can see... like, everything through that dress.",
"E05_ELIDR_d213": "I shouldn't be looking but... damn, she's really pretty.",
"E05_ELIDR_d214": "Even when she's all messed up, she's still... you know.",
"E05_ELIDR_d215": "Her dress is like, totally see-through... I can see her...",
"E05_ELIDR_d216": "Part of me feels like shit, part of me just... can't look away.",
"E05_ELIDR_d217": "Her dress is kinda see-through but I'm trying not to, like, notice.",
"E05_ELIDR_d218": "This guilt is seriously messing with my head.",
"E05_ELIDR_d219": "Take a good look, sweet boy. Remember this moment.",
"E05_ELIDR_d220": "She looks so peaceful now... so different from before.",
"E05_ELIDR_d221": "Was that real or just some fucked up dream?",
"E05_ELIDR_d222": "But I can still feel where she touched my hair...",
"E05_ELIDR_d223": "[mc_name]...? You're... still here...",
"E05_ELIDR_d224": "I'm here, Mom. How are you feeling?",
"E05_ELIDR_d225": "Had a... dream... about you... about us...",
"E05_ELIDR_d226": "You were so... young... shouldn't have... seen...",
"E05_ELIDR_d227": "What dream?",
"E05_ELIDR_d228": "Better left... as dreams... sweetheart...",
"E05_ELIDR_d229": "My phone's buzzing...",
"E05_ELIDR_d230": "A message from Madison? That's weird, she never texts me.",
"E05_ELIDR_d231": "'Hey big brother, remember we were supposed to hang out today? Come meet me at the main lobby right now. Don't keep me waiting.'",
"E05_ELIDR_d232": "Hang out? We never made plans... this sounds off.",
"E05_ELIDR_d233": "Madison doesn't talk like this. Too... polite? Formal?",
"E05_ELIDR_d234": "Since when does she call me 'big brother' unironically?",
"E05_ELIDR_d235": "Something's weird about this message.",
"E05_ELIDR_d236": "I don't want to leave Mom when she's finally talking about... whatever that was.",
"E05_ELIDR_d237": "But Madison never asks for anything. If she's reaching out...",
"E05_ELIDR_d238": "Maybe something's wrong?",

"E05_MICMC_d001": "That message was weird as fuck...",
"E05_MICMC_d002": "Madison? What are you doing here?",
"E05_MICMC_d003": "I texted you, remember? We need to talk.",
"E05_MICMC_d004": "About what? And why here?",
"E05_MICMC_d005": "About Mom. About Dad. About things you need to know.",
"E05_MICMC_d006": "She's being way too serious.",
"E05_MICMC_d007": "There he is. Right on time.",
"E05_MICMC_d008": "Dad.",
"E05_MICMC_d009": "[mc_name]. Still here?",
"E05_MICMC_d010": "I called him, Daddy. Just like we discussed.",
"E05_MICMC_d011": "Wait... they discussed this? What the fuck is going on?",
"E05_MICMC_d012": "Madison, dear, let the grown-ups handle this conversation.",
"E05_MICMC_d013": "Of course, Daddy. Sorry.",
"E05_MICMC_d014": "Huh? She just... apologized?",
"E05_MICMC_d015": "Before anything else, I need to know—what meds are you giving Mom?",
"E05_MICMC_d016": "Standard anti-anxiety protocol. Lorazepam, primarily.",
"E05_MICMC_d017": "Not that you'd understand the pharmacology, [mc_name].",
"E05_MICMC_d018": "Daddy knows what he's doing. He's helped Mom so much over the years.",
"E05_MICMC_d019": "Madison, sweetie, your father and brother need to discuss medical matters. Perhaps you should wait outside?",
"E05_MICMC_d020": "Oh... okay. I'll just... stand here quietly.",
"E05_MICMC_d021": "She's accepting being dismissed like a fucking child. What happened to the Madison who never backs down?",
"E05_MICMC_d022": "Cut the bullshit, Michael. What are you really giving her?",
"E05_MICMC_d023": "Such hostility. And here I thought police training taught discipline.",
"E05_MICMC_d024": "But then again, you've always been more emotion than intellect, haven't you?",
"E05_MICMC_d025": "I need to know exactly what medications she's been taking.",
"E05_MICMC_d026": "Your investigative instincts showing, [mc_name]? How... predictable.",
"E05_MICMC_d027": "Like a dog chasing cars, you bark loudly but comprehend nothing.",
"E05_MICMC_d028": "As her son, I have a right to know her treatment plan.",
"E05_MICMC_d029": "Rights. How quaint. Medical decisions require expertise, not familial sentiment.",
"E05_MICMC_d030": "Your 'rights' are as meaningless as your presence here.",
"E05_MICMC_d031": "I keep thinking about how she looked in that bed...",
"E05_MICMC_d032": "So pale, so fragile. The machines beeping around her like a fucking death watch.",
"E05_MICMC_d033": "Her hands... they were shaking even while she slept. What the hell has he done to her?",
"E05_MICMC_d034": "She looks like a ghost of herself.",
"E05_MICMC_d035": "Have you even seen her in that bed? She looked completely broken lying there.",
"E05_MICMC_d036": "Elizabeth has always been... fragile. You simply chose not to see it.",
"E05_MICMC_d037": "Or perhaps you were too self-absorbed to notice.",
"E05_MICMC_d038": "All those bottles I found in her bedroom...",
"E05_MICMC_d039": "Alprazolam, Clonazepam, some unmarked pills... enough to kill a horse.",
"E05_MICMC_d040": "Half of them had his clinic's labels, not proper pharmacy ones. That's not fucking normal.",
"E05_MICMC_d041": "The way they were scattered around like candy... how long has this been going on?",
"E05_MICMC_d042": "I saw the prescription bottles in her room. Half of them don't have proper pharmacy labels.",
"E05_MICMC_d043": "Custom compounds. I have them prepared at my clinic.",
"E05_MICMC_d044": "Far beyond anything your limited understanding could grasp.",
"E05_MICMC_d045": "That's not standard practice.",
"E05_MICMC_d046": "When did you become an expert in psychiatric medication, [mc_name]? Between getting shot and abandoning your responsibilities?",
"E05_MICMC_d047": "Your expertise extends to... what exactly? Getting yourself hospitalized? Spectacular achievement.",
"E05_MICMC_d048": "I... I never knew it was that serious.",
"E05_MICMC_d049": "Madison, dear, these are complex matters best left to those with actual education.",
"E05_MICMC_d050": "Yes, Daddy. I'm sorry for interrupting.",
"E05_MICMC_d051": "She's just... accepting his condescension. This isn't the Madison I know.",
"E05_MICMC_d052": "You're hiding something, and I'm going to find out what.",
"E05_MICMC_d053": "Such determination. Such... futility.",
"E05_MICMC_d054": "You couldn't even stay conscious during a simple arrest. What makes you think you can solve this?",
"E05_MICMC_d055": "I don't need to be a doctor to recognize malpractice.",
"E05_MICMC_d056": "Malpractice? From someone who let criminals put a bullet in him?",
"E05_MICMC_d057": "Your judgment has proven... questionable at best.",
"E05_MICMC_d058": "There are medical boards that review cases like this.",
"E05_MICMC_d059": "Medical boards staffed by my dear colleagues. How charmingly naive.",
"E05_MICMC_d060": "You still believe in systems, don't you? After everything you've seen?",
"E05_MICMC_d061": "Your mother's condition requires specialized treatment that isn't available through conventional channels.",
"E05_MICMC_d062": "Elizabeth has always had... episodes. Instability. More severe than you've been allowed to see.",
"E05_MICMC_d063": "I developed a regimen that gives her peace. Stability.",
"E05_MICMC_d064": "Memory reconsolidation inhibitors combined with targeted anxiolytics.",
"E05_MICMC_d065": "Memory inhibitors? You're suppressing her memories?",
"E05_MICMC_d066": "I'm treating intrusive traumatic recall patterns. It's cutting-edge psychiatry.",
"E05_MICMC_d067": "Far beyond your comprehension, naturally.",
"E05_MICMC_d068": "You're fucking experimenting on her!",
"E05_MICMC_d069": "Such language. Such... impotence.",
"E05_MICMC_d070": "Emotional volatility. Perhaps you inherited more from your mother than I hoped.",
"E05_MICMC_d071": "Does she know what these pills actually do?",
"E05_MICMC_d072": "Informed consent is a luxury Elizabeth cannot afford in her current state.",
"E05_MICMC_d073": "But I wouldn't expect you to understand such nuances.",
"E05_MICMC_d074": "That's illegal. Unethical. You're violating her basic rights.",
"E05_MICMC_d075": "Ethics are subjective, especially in medical advancement.",
"E05_MICMC_d076": "Your morality is as rigid as your thinking. Both equally useless.",
"E05_MICMC_d077": "My research has helped countless patients find peace from traumatic memories.",
"E05_MICMC_d078": "Though I doubt you'd appreciate the elegance of the methodology.",
"E05_MICMC_d079": "Research? Is that all Mom is to you? A test subject?",
"E05_MICMC_d080": "She's a case study in successful memory modification. One of my greatest achievements.",
"E05_MICMC_d081": "He's talking about her like she's not even human. And I can't do anything to stop him.",
"E05_MICMC_d082": "Your mother witnessed something she shouldn't have. Many years ago.",
"E05_MICMC_d083": "Something that... affected her deeply.",
"E05_MICMC_d084": "What did she see?",
"E05_MICMC_d085": "That's not important. What matters is that knowing endangered her. Endangered all of us.",
"E05_MICMC_d086": "But again, strategic thinking was never your strength.",
"E05_MICMC_d087": "I protected her the only way I could – by helping her forget.",
"E05_MICMC_d088": "She's remembering now, isn't she? That's why you're panicking.",
"E05_MICMC_d089": "I can see it in your eyes. Your perfect little experiment is falling apart.",
"E05_MICMC_d090": "Got him. He actually looks uncomfortable for the first time.",
"E05_MICMC_d091": "Panicking? How delightfully naive.",
"E05_MICMC_d092": "I don't panic, [mc_name]. I adapt. Which is why I've had Elizabeth committed for psychiatric evaluation.",
"E05_MICMC_d093": "Seventy-two hours minimum, potentially extendable to thirty days.",
"E05_MICMC_d094": "You can't do this.",
"E05_MICMC_d095": "Your opinion, as always, is irrelevant.",
"E05_MICMC_d096": "I'll handle this myself. You won't get away with this.",
"E05_MICMC_d097": "Handle it yourself? Like you handled that arrest in Osaka?",
"E05_MICMC_d098": "Your track record for 'handling' things is rather... unimpressive.",
"E05_MICMC_d099": "I'll investigate this through proper channels.",
"E05_MICMC_d100": "With what evidence? Your detective's intuition?",
"E05_MICMC_d101": "You have nothing. You are nothing. You can do nothing.",
"E05_MICMC_d102": "I'll file an official report about this.",
"E05_MICMC_d103": "Reports filed by detectives under psychological stress? How credible.",
"E05_MICMC_d104": "Your department might find your mental state... questionable.",
"E05_MICMC_d105": "I won't let you destroy her mind.",
"E05_MICMC_d106": "You won't 'let' me? How presumptuous.",
"E05_MICMC_d107": "You couldn't even stay alert during a simple police operation. What makes you think you can protect anyone?",
"E05_MICMC_d108": "Consider this carefully, [mc_name]. Elizabeth is fragile. What happens if these memories return in full?",
"E05_MICMC_d109": "The trauma, the fear... is that what you want for her? To suffer for the sake of your conscience?",
"E05_MICMC_d110": "Maybe we should listen to Daddy...",
"E05_MICMC_d111": "Madison understands. Youth often sees more clearly than... experience.",
"E05_MICMC_d112": "Besides, should you choose to make this... difficult... well, careers can also be so fragile.",
"E05_MICMC_d113": "Are you threatening me?",
"E05_MICMC_d114": "I'm educating you about consequences. Something your generation seems to lack.",
"E05_MICMC_d115": "Your superiors might find certain information about our family... illuminating.",
"E05_MICMC_d116": "What does he mean?",
"E05_MICMC_d117": "You sick bastard.",
"E05_MICMC_d118": "Security cameras in my home capture quite... comprehensive footage, [mc_name].",
"E05_MICMC_d119": "Footage that could end careers, destroy reputations, ruin lives.",
"E05_MICMC_d120": "Daddy, what kind of footage?",
"E05_MICMC_d121": "Nothing that concerns you, dear.",
"E05_MICMC_d122": "Oh. Okay.",
"E05_MICMC_d123": "Huh? Okay? What the fuck happened to her?",
"E05_MICMC_d124": "I had such hopes when you were born. The Crawford name, continuing in medicine perhaps.",
"E05_MICMC_d125": "Instead, you became... this. A failed detective, obsessing over your mother, doing all that stuff you do at the house.",
"E05_MICMC_d126": "Stuff?",
"E05_MICMC_d127": "Madison, sometimes truth is more complex than young minds can process.",
"E05_MICMC_d128": "I understand, Daddy.",
"E05_MICMC_d129": "She's just... accepting whatever he tells her.",
"E05_MICMC_d130": "You're more like Elizabeth than me. Weak. Sentimental. Easily broken.",
"E05_MICMC_d131": "At least she had beauty to offer. You have... what exactly?",
"E05_MICMC_d132": "At least I'm not experimenting on my family.",
"E05_MICMC_d133": "My dear boy, that's exactly what you're doing. Just without the scientific method.",
"E05_MICMC_d134": "Without the intelligence. Without the vision. Without any meaningful result.",
"E05_MICMC_d135": "Seven to nine, visiting hours. I'll make sure Elizabeth is lucid enough to recognize you.",
"E05_MICMC_d136": "Though I doubt she'll want to see the son who couldn't protect her.",
"E05_MICMC_d137": "Enjoy the rest of your night, [mc_name].",
"E05_MICMC_d138": "He's walking away. Just... walking away like I'm nothing.",
"E05_MICMC_d139": "[mc_name]? Are you okay? You look...",
"E05_MICMC_d140": "She sounds concerned. Actually concerned. When did that happen?",
"E05_MICMC_d141": "But it's too late. He's already won everything.",
"E05_MICMC_d142": "I can't protect Mom. Can't protect anyone. He made that crystal fucking clear.",
"E05_MICMC_d143": "Madison's walking away too. Probably back to him.",
"E05_MICMC_d144": "Everyone always goes back to him.",
"E05_MICMC_d145": "I'm completely alone here. Just like I've always been.",
"E05_MICMC_d146": "He's right about everything. I am weak. I am useless.",
"E05_MICMC_d147": "And now Mom's going to suffer because I couldn't stop him.",
"E05_MICMC_d148": "What kind of son am I? What kind of man?",

"E05_ENDAC_d001": "You missed your appointment yesterday.",
"E05_ENDAC_d002": "Explain what? How you planned to sell those implants to the Yamaguchi-gumi?",
"E05_ENDAC_d003": "Scalpel. We need clean incisions.",
"E05_ENDAC_d004": "Understand this—before anything.",
"E05_ENDAC_d005": "This isn't money. It's control.",
"E05_ENDAC_d006": "Tell me exactly where you were yesterday at 3 PM.",
"E05_ENDAC_d007": "Witnesses can be bought. Loyalty cannot.",
"E05_ENDAC_d008": "You know what happens to people who betray the Kudō-kai?",
"E05_ENDAC_d009": "Your mother will wonder why you never came home.",
"E05_ENDAC_d010": "Last chance to tell the truth.",
"E05_ENDAC_d011": "Proof is irrelevant now.",
"E05_ENDAC_d012": "Proceed with the left implant.",
"E05_ENDAC_d013": "Left. And take your time.",
"E05_ENDAC_d014": "Continue with the second one.",
"E05_ENDAC_d015": "Good. No damage to the cocaine packets.",
"E05_ENDAC_d016": "No. Give me the blade.",
"E05_ENDAC_d017": "Yes. This part I do myself.",
"E05_ENDAC_d018": "Leave us alone for a moment.",
"E05_ENDAC_d019": "I'm so sorry... I'm so, so sorry...",
"E05_ENDAC_d020": "You didn't deserve this. Your mother needed you.",
"E05_ENDAC_d021": "I'll make sure she knows you tried to come home.",
"E05_ENDAC_d022": "I promise. I'll find a way to let her know.",
"E05_ENDAC_d023": "Rest now. No more pain.",
"E05_ENDAC_d024": "Clean up this mess.",
"E05_ENDAC_d025": "What about her? This garbage is no longer our concern.",
"E05_ENDAC_d026": "I said nothing. Let's move the body.",
"E05_ENDAC_d027": "The product is intact. Two packets, fifty grams each.",
"E05_ENDAC_d028": "Is that the only reason you keep me around?",
"E05_ENDAC_d029": "And what's the next territory?",
"E05_ENDAC_d030": "What kind of loose ends?",
"E05_ENDAC_d031": "I handled that cleanly. No witnesses.",
"E05_ENDAC_d032": "What do you need me to do?",
"E05_ENDAC_d033": "In Tokyo? That's Sumiyoshi-kai territory.",
"E05_ENDAC_d034": "I understand.",
"E05_ENDAC_d035": "Come, little fox spirit. Time to return to sacred ground.",
"E05_ENDAC_d036": "Do you remember when Uncle Takeshi first brought you here?",
"E05_ENDAC_d037": "You believed the fox spirits could grant wishes for good people.",
"E05_ENDAC_d038": "Such pure prayers you whispered to stone guardians.",
"E05_ENDAC_d039": "Each red torii marks a threshold between worlds.",
"E05_ENDAC_d040": "Between who you were and who you must become.",
"E05_ENDAC_d041": "The foxes understand that some transformations are necessary.",
"E05_ENDAC_d042": "That sometimes we must become what the world needs us to be.",
"E05_ENDAC_d043": "Kneel before Inari's messenger, little one.",
"E05_ENDAC_d044": "The fox who serves the god of rice and prosperity.",
"E05_ENDAC_d045": "But also justice. Divine justice that humans cannot provide.",
"E05_ENDAC_d046": "The gods see what mortals cannot.",
"E05_ENDAC_d047": "Strip away the lies you wear like armor.",
"E05_ENDAC_d048": "No clothes to hide the scars, no mask to hide the truth.",
"E05_ENDAC_d049": "This is the body that carried his child.",
"E05_ENDAC_d050": "This is the flesh that survived when love was stolen.",
"E05_ENDAC_d051": "Touch the marks they left on you.",
"E05_ENDAC_d052": "Isabella's birth scar. Bullet wounds from when evil tried to silence you.",
"E05_ENDAC_d053": "Each scar a reminder of what was taken.",
"E05_ENDAC_d054": "But you survived. Wounded, changed, but with purpose.",
"E05_ENDAC_d055": "Time for the green mask, little fox.",
"E05_ENDAC_d056": "The one that speaks wisdom wrapped in kindness.",
"E05_ENDAC_d057": "In folklore, green foxes bring important messages to those who need guidance.",
"E05_ENDAC_d058": "They appear to warn the good of hidden dangers.",
"E05_ENDAC_d059": "Tomorrow, you'll find him again.",
"E05_ENDAC_d060": "The good man who deserves to know the truth about his world.",
"E05_ENDAC_d061": "He thinks he understands justice, but he hasn't seen the deeper corruption.",
"E05_ENDAC_d062": "Sleep now, little spirit. Kitsune must help the righteous see clearly.",

"E05_RNDM_d001": "Mr. [mc_name]? Your mother is asking for you.",
"E05_RNDM_d002": "Please... I don't understand why I'm here...",
"E05_RNDM_d003": "What did I do wrong? I've been loyal, I swear!",
"E05_RNDM_d004": "My mother... she got sick! I had to take care of her!",
"E05_RNDM_d005": "I was going to come today, I promise! Please, just let me explain!",
"E05_RNDM_d006": "No! I would never! My mother had a stroke!",
"E05_RNDM_d007": "Please! You have to believe me! I have the hospital discharge papers!",

"E05_RNDM_d017": "Ready when you are.",
"E05_RNDM_d018": "Wait! Please! I have photos from the hospital!",
"E05_RNDM_d019": "This will hurt considerably.",
"E05_RNDM_d020": "Please! I have video calls with the nurses! Check my phone!",
"E05_RNDM_d021": "I would never betray the family that feeds me!",

"E05_RNDM_d028": "Fresh scalpel for the final cut?",
"E05_RNDM_d029": "As you wish.",
"E05_RNDM_d030": "Why... why did this happen...",
"E05_RNDM_d031": "Just tell her I tried... I really did. I tried to take care of her...",
"E05_RNDM_d032": "So cold... can't feel anything anymore...",
"E05_RNDM_d033": "What about the mother?",
"E05_RNDM_d034": "But you said—",
"E05_RNDM_d035": "Efficient as always, Bertolini.",
"E05_RNDM_d036": "Your foreign blood serves us well. Police never suspect a gaijin of yakuza connections.",
"E05_RNDM_d037": "You blend into crowds we cannot. Move through territories without suspicion.",

"E05_RNDM_d041": "Eliminate the detective leading the investigation. Make it look like gang violence.",
"E05_RNDM_d042": "Exactly. Let them take the blame while we expand our operations.",

"E05_RNDM_d044": "Scalpel or bone saw first?"
